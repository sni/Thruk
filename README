Thruk - Monitoring Webinterface
===============================

Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently
supports Nagios and Icinga as backend using the MKLivestatus addon.
It was designed to be a "dropin" replacement. The target is to cover
100% of the original features plus additional enhancements for large
installations.

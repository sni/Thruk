THIS IS A FORK REPOSITORY OF THRUK

It's an example on how graphics can be inserted on details pages.

This working example show an iframe containing a google webpage on details pages of host or services.

You have to change the "graph_word" variable declared in thruk_local.conf in order to match with your graphics broker.

And of course you have to specify the link of your graph in your action_url (shinken).

####### example usage ################

--In your shinken configuration, insert an action_url on a service that contain the word "services"

	## for example ##

	# And the Trending service that check it
	define service{
        	service_description             LocalLoad__load1_Trending
        	use                             local-service         ; Name of service template to use
        	host_name                       localhost
		action_url 			http://www.google.fr/services/
        	check_command                   check_trending!LocalLoad!load1!20%!50%
        	check_interval                  1
        	}
	################

--Then launch your Thruk.

--Go see the status of this service, and you will see an iframe containing the google web page...

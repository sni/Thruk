Description: Monitoring Webinterface for Nagios/Icinga and Shinken
 Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface which currently
 supports Nagios, Icinga and Shinken as backend using the Livestatus
 API. It is designed to be a 'dropin' replacement and covers almost
 all of the original features plus adds additional enhancements for
 large installations. This is the metapackage for complete Thruk setup.

Thruk Users Guide
=================

== Introduction

Thruk is a multibackend monitoring web interface which currently
supports Nagios, Icinga and Shinken as backend using the Livestatus
API. It is designed to be a 'drop in' replacement and covers almost
all of the original features plus adds additional enhancements for
large installations.

Main Features / Advantages

  * multiple backends
  * faster, no need to parse status.dat for every request
  * less cpu usage
  * display live data, no delay between core and gui
  * independent from monitoring core, can be installed on remote host
  * clusterable, can be clustered over hosts
  * change status.cgi filter inline
  * extended logfile search
  * better logging, uses log4perl (who submitted which command?)
  * valid HTML code
  * no frames ( can be re-enabled for better addon integration)
  * easy to extend with plugins
  * 100% Perl (using Catalyst Framework)
  * paging ( can be disabled and customized )
  * multiple themes included
  * Excel export for status and logfiles
  * Adjustable side menu
  * Full expanded plugin commandline for easy testing
  * Save searches like bookmarks
  * Config Tool included
  * Mobile interface included
  * SLA Reports in PDF format
  * Recurring Downtimes
  * Fully Featured Dashboard



=== How it works

Thruk is written in Perl using the
http://www.catalystframework.org[Catalyst Framework]. Backend
monitoring systems will be connected with the
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Livestatus[Monitoring::Livestatus]
Perl Module. Thruk itself is running as a fastcgi process.
Availability will be calculated with
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Availability[Monitoring::Availability].
Authentication is provided by the Apache webserver (For example with
mod_auth_basic, mod_auth_ldap, mod_auth_mysql, ...).

=== Reasons to choose Thruk

There are a couple of cool things in Thruk. A few of them are listed
here.

==== Multi Site Support

Thruk connects to as many cores as you want. You could even combine
Nagios, Icinga and Shinken instances into one big combined view. That
way you get the advantage of several independent locations and still
have an overview about all your installations. Sites can be put into
groups for better arrangement.

image:source/multi_site.png[Multi Site]


==== SLA Reports
The 'reporting' plugin creates comprehensive SLA reports in HTML and PDF format
which may be send by mail at regular intervals. Besides that you may turn any
page in Thruk into a regular E-Mail report.

image:source/sla_reporting.png[SLA Reporting]


==== Excel Export and Bookmarks

The Bookmarks feature allows you to save your searches and add them as
your personal menu item. Besides the bookmarks, you can adjust the
menu easily with the menu_local.conf for all users.

The Excel export creates real Excel files which can be send by mail or
used to extract hostnames and other information.

image:source/Bookmarks_and_excel_export.png[Bookmarks and Excel Export]


==== Config Tool

The Config Tool makes is very easy to change object configuration of
your monitoring solution. It also allows you to make quick changes to your
Thruk configuration, as well as managing user access via htpasswd
files or adjusting your cgi.cfg.

image:source/Config_Tool.png[Config Tool]


==== Sending Multiple Commands

The new status pages makes it very convenient to send multiple commands
at once. It is even possible to send host and service commands at the
same time. When rescheduling hosts and services, Thruk will wait until
your check is finished and display the result as soon as the check has
come back.

image:source/Reschedule.png[Multiple Commands]


==== Easy Filtering

Remember the days when you had to guess numbers in the url to filter
hosts or services. With Thruk it's possible to quickly change your
display filter. You can combine multiple filter to create whatever
views you like. An Ajax search supports you, so you don't have to
guess host or service names, plus you get the power of regular expressions.

image:source/Filter.png[Easy Filtering]


==== PNP4Nagios Graphs

When your action_url contains /pnp4nagios/, there will be automatically
a graph displayed for your host and service. This gives you a quick
view about the performance history. The image is then linked to
PNP4Nagios to get detailed information.

image:source/PNP4nagios.png[PNP4Nagios]


==== Multiple Lines of Plugin Output

When your check returns multiple lines of plugin output. Thruk marks
the output in blue and a click on it displays the complete output.
This is especially useful for check_multi checks. In addition to
that, the comments and downtimes also have a small popup with their
data. So you don't have to open the host/service page just to see who
set a comment and when there is a downtime.

image:source/PluginOutput.png[Multiple Lines of Plugin Output]


==== Mine Map

The Mine Map is the perfect tool to get a quick overview. It is
especially useful if you have a lot of common services across your
hosts. Otherwise use hostgroups or servicegroups for nice results.
Normal filtering is possible too.

image:source/MineMap.png[Mine Map]


==== Mobile Interface

The Mobile interface gives you access to the most important things
and allows you to quickly view and acknowledge problems.

== Installation

There are several ways of installing Thruk.

=== Labs Consol Repository
The https://labs.consol.de/repo/[Labs Repository] provides packages of
latest Thruk releases (including daily development builds) and other
Tools like Mod-Gearman. Just follow the guide on the labs page for
your distribution.


=== OMD
An easy way of installing Thruk is using OMD from
http://omdistro.org[omdistro.org]. There are Debian, Ubuntu, Centos
and Suse Packages containing preconfigured latest versions of Nagios
and Thruk. The package also includes Icinga, Shinken, pnp4nagios,
check_mk and Nagvis. OMD is the recommended way of installing new
Nagios / Thruk setups when you want to install several addons at once.


=== Use Packages
Standalone installation from a binary package is another easy way
to get Thruk running.

Download packages from http://www.thruk.org/files/pkg/

All packages have the following filesystem structure:

-------
  /etc/thruk                       Thruks config
  /etc/httpd/conf.d/thruk.conf     Apache config
  /usr/share/thruk                 shared files
  /usr/lib/thruk/perl5             Perl libraries
  /var/cache/thruk                 temporary files
  /var/lib/thruk                   stored user settings
-------

After installation, Thruk is available at http://your-host/thruk/ and
has a default user 'thrukadmin' with password 'thrukadmin' configured.
You may need to change backend configuration. This should be done in
the thruk_local.conf where all settings can be overridden.



==== Debian / Ubuntu

-------
  #> dpkg -i thruk_1.66_debian6_amd64.deb
-------

In case of dependency errors, run 'apt-get -f install' and try the
'dpkg -i...' again.


==== Centos / Redhat

-------
  #> yum install --nogpgcheck thruk-1.66-1.rhel6.x86_64.rpm
-------

You may need to include an external repository for mod_fastcgi module.
Epel or Rpmforge should do it.


==== SLES

-------
  #> zypper install thruk-1.66-1.sles11.x86_64.rpm
-------

You may need the SLES sdk dvd for additional dependencies.



=== Install from Source
==== Installation Steps
===== Requirements

[IMPORTANT]
.Experienced Users Only
=======
Source installation is for experienced users only. Using
packages/repositories should be the preferred solution in almost all
situations. Especially for production environments.
=======


In order to install the Thruk Monitoring Webinterface from source you
will need the following:

- Perl
- Git Client
- compiler tools: automake, make, g++, gcc
- Apache Webserver (optional for fastcgi only)

===== Create New User
refer to your systems manual on how to add new user.
This guide uses the following:

-------
  user:  thruk
  group: thruk
-------


IMPORTANT: all following steps should be done by the thruk user.

===== Install Local::Lib


Follow the steps on http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib#The_bootstrapping_technique

quick guide:

-------
  %> su - thruk
  %> wget %http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/A/AP/APEIRON/local-lib-1.008004.tar.gz
  %> tar zxf local-lib-1.008004.tar.gz
  %> cd local-lib-1.008004
  %> perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap && make install
-------

[TIP]
.proxy configuration
=======
if you need a proxy configuration, you should answer <no> at this question:

 Would you like me to configure as much as possible automatically? [yes]

Setting a proper http_proxy/ftp_proxy environment should work for the automatic
configuration.
=======


Add the following line to the thruk users .profile or .bashrc

 eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)

logout and login again and verify that your perl env looks like this:

-------
 %> env | grep perl
 PERL5LIB=/home/thruk/perl5/lib/perl5:/home/thruk/perl5/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi
 MODULEBUILDRC=/home/thruk/perl5/.modulebuildrc
 PATH=/home/thruk/perl5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games
 PERL_MM_OPT=INSTALL_BASE=/home/thruk/perl5
-------


===== Install Module::Install
-------
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Install::Catalyst'
-------


===== Git Clone Thruk

-------
    git clone https://github.com/sni/Thruk.git
    cd Thruk
    perl Makefile.PL
-------

press <enter> here:
-------
  ==> Auto-install the 35 mandatory module(s) from CPAN? [y]
-------

then run make
-------
    make
-------

This may take a while, as there are probably several modules missing.


[TIP]
.yes
=======
you can use /usr/bin/yes to automatically answer all questions with
yes. (yes | make)
=======


Press <y> at this questions:
-------
  Do you want to build the XS Stash module? [y]
  Do you want to use the XS Stash by default? [y]
-------

run perl Makefile.PL again to see if all dependencies are now installed properly.

-------
    perl Makefile.PL
-------


===== Configuration

Copy 'thruk.conf' to 'thruk_local.conf' and adjust the livestatus settings to your needs.
-------
  %> cp thruk.conf thruk_local.conf
-------
The thruk.conf will be overwritten with new defaults on updates. The
thruk_local.conf contains the local overrides and will never be
overwritten.


Edit 'cgi.conf' and adjust settings to your needs.

See the <<Thruk Configuration>> section for detailed explanation of configuration options.



===== Start Server
After running these steps successfully, you should be able to test your
installation:

-------
    ./script/thruk_server.pl
-------

Open your browser and open http://<your_host>:3000




== Apache Configuration

[TIP]
.apache is preconfigured when using packages
=======
Apache configuration is not needed if you use OMD or packages. Apache
is already preconfigured in that case.
=======

Integration in the Apache webserver is done by fastcgi.  There are two
fastcgi modules for Apache at the moment. Choose the one which fits
best into your environment. If unsure, use <<_mod_fcgid,mod_fcgid>>.
The main difference is, that mod_fcgid starts the fastcgi process upon
the first request whereas in mod_fastcgi you have to start the fastcgi
process by yourself.

Do not use the port 3000 thruk server in production, it's only for
testing and development. It cannot handle authentication and is slower
than the fastcgi variants.


[TIP]
.lighthttpd
=======
Francois Ponsard wrote an article on how to integrate Thruk in Lighthttpd:
http://www.dahwa.fr/dotclear/index.php?post/2011/03/15/Thruk-in-Lighttpd
=======


=== mod_fcgid

IMPORTANT: Thruk runs with the webserver user in this scenario, make
sure the webserver user has access to all Thruk files and perl modules.

.Apache configuration with mod_fcgid
-------
LoadModule fcgid_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_fcgid.so
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName   thruk.company.local

    DocumentRoot /home/thruk/Thruk/root/
    CustomLog    /home/thruk/Thruk/logs/access.log combined
    ErrorLog     /home/thruk/Thruk/logs/error.log

    <Directory /home/thruk/Thruk/root/>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>

    AliasMatch /thruk/(.*\.cgi|.*\.html)  /home/thruk/Thruk/script/thruk_fastcgi.pl/thruk/$1
    <Location /thruk>
        Options ExecCGI
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        AuthName "Monitoring Access"
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /home/thruk/Thruk/htpasswd.users
        Require valid-user
    </Location>

    <IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
      AddHandler fcgid-script .pl
      MaxRequestsPerProcess 100
    </IfModule>

</VirtualHost>
-------


=== mod_fastcgi

start your fcgi server:

-------
    %>./script/thruk_fastcgi.pl -n 5 \
                -l /tmp/thruk_fastcgi.socket \
                -p /tmp/thruk_fastcgi.pid
-------

you may want to copy the init.d script to /etc/init.d and adjust its paths:
-------
    %> sudo cp ./script/thruk_fastcgi_server.sh /etc/init.d/thruk_fastcgi_server
    %> vi /etc/init.d/thruk_fastcgi_server
    %> sudo chown root: /etc/init.d/thruk_fastcgi_server
-------

Or create a custom init.d script (additional modules required) with:
-------
    %> ./script/thruk_create.pl FastCGI::ExternalServer l=/tmp/thruk_fastcgi.socket n=5 p=/tmp/thruk_fastcgi.pid
-------



use this apache example configuration:

- replace /home/thruk/Thruk with your installation path
- replace your-web-host.local with your hostname
- create a /home/thruk/Thruk/htpasswd.users with htpasswd2
- make sure the /home/thruk/Thruk/logs/ directory exists

</VirtualHost>
-------





== Backend Configuration

You may connect multiple backends into one Thruk interface. Just specify
multiple 'peer' items.

=== Livestatus

Livestatus is a addon for Nagios or Icinga which provides real time
status data. Contrary to database addons it adds very little overhead to the
Nagios core which makes livestatus based gui fast and real time.

[TIP]
.Shinken
=======
Shinken has livestatus support built-in and does not require additional
modules.
=======

Refer to http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html#H1:%20Setting%20up%20and%20using%20Livestatus
on how to install livestatus onto your monitoring box. The
<<_labs_consol_repository,Lab Consol Repository>> has livestatus rpm
packages. For debian based Linux systems just use the provided
packages of your distribution.

Basically you have to build the NEB module and add it to your nagios/icinga.cfg.

-------
 broker_module=/opt/local/livestatus/livestatus.o /tmp/live.sock
-------

Then use the socket as 'peer' parameter in your backend configuration.

.Livestatus Architecture

=== HTTP

A HTTP connection is possible between multiple Thruk installations. A
HTTP connection not only makes live data available, it also offers a
secure way to manage object configuration from remote. To authenticate
the central Thruk installation, you need to provide the secret key from the
slave instance. This setup is perfect for managing several independent
installations from a central point of view.

[TIP]
.use SSL
=======
It's strongly recommended to use HTTPS for remote connections.
=======

-------
    # package installation
    %> cat /var/lib/thruk/secret.key

    # omd site
    OMD[site]:~$ cat var/thruk/secret.key
-------

.HTTP Architecture
image:source/livestatus_http.png[HTTP Architecture]



=== MongoDB
A MongoDB can be used to faster access logfiles. Livestatus caches
logfile data used for queries. This increases the size of the nagios
process, slows down the monitoring and increases the overall load on
your monitoring host. Therefor Thruk may use a MongoDB as logfile
cache.

ex.:

  logcache = localhost:27017/thruk_logs


.MongoDB Architecture
image:source/livestatus_mongodb.png[MongoDB Architecture]

For maximum performance, the MongoDB should be installed on the same
server as Thruk itself.

It's a good idea to import the logfiles after enabling the
logfilecache:

Initial import:
-------
    %> thruk -a logcacheimport
-------

Be careful, the 'logcacheimport' deletes all current cached data, so only
do that once.


Logfile Cache Update
-------
    %> thruk -a logcacheupdate
-------

The logcacheupdate imports the delta since the last update. That's pretty
fast and done automatically whenever you access logfiles via Thruk.

There is also a command to check the current usage statistics of your
logfile cache:

-------
    %> thruk -a logcachestats
    Backend              Index Size      Data Size       Items
    Devel                 14.4 MB        136.4 MB       238104
-------






== Thruk Configuration

Configuration is managed mainly in these configuration files.

-------
  * thruk.conf          # shipped default Thruk config
  * thruk_local.conf    # local override of Thruks settings
  * cgi.cfg             # Nagios cgi.cfg
  * log4perl.conf       # Logging configuration
  * menu.conf           # Thruks default side navigation
  * menu_local.conf     # local override for the navigation
-------

%subtoc%

=== Config Files

==== thruk.conf

The thruk.conf contains the shipped defaults. You should not edit this
file directly. Overwrite your settings in your thruk_local.conf
instead.


==== thruk_local.conf

The thruk_local.conf is a copy of the thruk.conf. Both files are used by thruk.
The idea is, that the thruk.conf is provided with the packaged defaults and the
thruk_local.conf is to override these settings where needed.





=== General Settings


==== title_prefix

set the title prefix for all urls
this piece of text will be prepended to
all page titles.

ex.:

  title_prefix = Prod


==== url_prefix

Changes the usual url path for Thruk. Don't change it unless you plan
to run multiple Thruk instances on the same webserver. You will have
to change your fastcgi configuration too.

ex.:

  url_prefix = /


==== use_timezone

Changes the timezone from the systems default to this timezone.
Only set this if you have trouble with displaying the right timestamps.

ex.:

  use_timezone = CET


==== mobile_agent
Specify user agents which will be redirected to the mobile plugin (if
enabled).

ex.:

  mobile_agent=iPhone,Android,IEMobile


==== default_theme

Default theme to use for all users. Must be a valid sub directory in
the themes folder.

ex.:

  default_theme = Thruk


==== first_day_of_week
Set first day of week. Used in reports.
 Sunday: 0
 Monday: 1

ex.:

  first_day_of_week = 0


==== report_use_temp_files
Large reports will use temp files to avoid extreme memory usage.
With 'report_use_temp_files' you may set the report duration in days
which will trigger the use of temp files. Default is 14days, so
for example the 'last31days' report will use temp files, the 'thisweek'
not. Can be disabled by setting to 0.

ex.:

  report_use_temp_files = 14


==== start_page

This link is used as startpage and points usually to the main.html
with displays version information and general links.

ex.:

  start_page = /thruk/main.html


==== documentation_link

This link is used in the side navigation menu as link to the documentation.
Replace it with whatever your documentation is located. Set it to a blank value
if you don't want a documentation link in the menu at all.

ex.:

  documentation_link = /thruk/docs/


==== all_problems_link

Customizable link for the 'problems' link in side menu. Can be useful
to reflect your companies process of error handling.

ex.:

  all_problems_link = /thruk/cgi-bin/status.cgi?...


==== allowed_frame_links

List of allowed patterns, where links inside frames can be set to.
You can link to /thruk/frame.html?link=http://wiki.my-company.com/page/blah
Your wiki will then be displayed with the Thruk navigation frame.
Useful for other addons, so they don't have to display a own
navigation.

ex.:

  allowed_frame_links = http://intranet.my-company.com
  allowed_frame_links = https://wiki.my-company.com





=== Authorization Settings


==== can_submit_commands
Set this if a contact should be allowed to send commands unless defined for the
contact itself. This is the default value for all contacts unless the user has
a can_submit_commands setting in your monitoring configuration.

ex.:

  can_submit_commands = 1


==== command_disabled
Use this to disabled specific commands. Can be use multiple times to disabled
multiple commands. The number can be found in the 'cmd_typ' cgi parameter from
links to the command page.
You may use ranges here.

ex.:

  command_disabled = 14
  command_disabled = 35
  command_disabled = 17-34,50-65


==== make_auth_user_lowercase

Convert authenticated username to lowercase.

ex.:

  make_auth_user_lowercase = 1


==== make_auth_user_uppercase

Convert authenticated username to uppercase.

ex.:

  make_auth_user_uppercase = 1


==== use_strict_host_authorization

When set to a true value, every contact will only see the hosts where
he is contact for plus the services where he is contact for. When
disabled, a host contact will see all services for this host
regardless of whether he is a service contact or not.

ex.:

  use_strict_host_authorization = 1





=== Path Settings

==== cgi_cfg

The path to your cgi.cfg. See <<_cgi_cfg_2,cgi.cfg>> for details.

ex.:

  cgi_cfg = cgi.cfg


==== log4perl_conf

The path to your log4perl configuration file.

ex.:

  log4perl_conf = ./log4perl.conf


==== plugin_path

Path to your plugins directory. Can be used to specify different
location for you Thruk plugins. Don't forget to set appropriate apache
alias or rewrite rules when changing the plugin path. Otherwise the
static content from plugins is not accessible.

Example redirect rule for apache:

+++++
 AliasMatch /thruk/plugins/(.*?)/(.*)$ <your-plugin-dir>/plugins/plugins-enabled/$1/root/$2
+++++

ex.:

  plugin_path = ./plugins


==== themes_path

Path to your themes directory. Can be used to specify different
location for you Thruk themes. Don't forget to set appropriate apache
alias or rewrite rules when changing the themes path. Otherwise the
static content from your themes may not accessible.

+++++
 Alias /thruk/themes/ <your-themes-dir>/themes/themes-enabled/
+++++

ex.:

  themes_path = ./themes


==== var_path

Path to the var directory. Thruk stores user specific date here.

ex.:

  var_path = ./var


==== tmp_path

Path to a temporary directory. Defaults to /tmp if not set and usually
this is a good place.

ex.:

  tmp_path = /tmp


==== ssi_path

The path to your ssi (server side includes) files. See
<<_server_side_includes,Server Side Includes>> for details.

ex.:

  ssi_path = ssi/


==== user_template_path

Specify a additional directory for user supplied templates. This makes
it easy to override thruks own templates.
Template search order is:

 * users template path
 * themes template path
 * plugins template path
 * thruks template path

ex.:

  user_template_path = ./my_templates


==== logo_path_prefix

Changes the path to your logo images. Default is
$url_prefix+'thruk/themes/'+$current_theme+'/images/logos/' and
therefor relative to the current selected theme. You could set a fixed
path here.
Like usual, paths starting with a / will be absolute from your
webserver root directory. Paths starting without a / will be relative
to the cgi directory.

ex.:

  logo_path_prefix = /icons/


==== physical_logo_path

passwords or any other data which should not be displayed. Instead of
using a general 'resource_file' you could define one file per peer in your
peer config.

ex.:

  resource_file = /etc/nagios3/resource.cfg






=== Search Settings

==== show_backends_in_table
Display the backend/site name in the status table.
This is useful if you have same hosts or services on different
backends and need to know which one returns an error.
Valid values are:

 1 - show site name at the end
 2 - put site name in front

ex.:

  show_backends_in_table = 0

You need to have the config tool plugin enabled
and you need proper permissions for the link to appear.

ex.:

  show_config_edit_buttons = 1


==== show_full_commandline
Display the full command line for host / service checks .
Be warned, the command line could contain passwords and other confidential data.
In order to replace the user macros for commands, you have to set the
'resource_file' in your peer config or the general 'resource_file' option.

 * 0 = off, don't show the command line at all
 * 1 = show them for contacts with the role: authorized_for_configuration_information
 * 2 = show them for everyone

ex.:

  show_full_commandline = 0



==== show_full_commandline_source
Usually the source of your expanded check_command should
be the check_command attribute of your host / service. But under
certain circumstances you might want to use display expanded
commands from a custom variable. In this case, set
'show_full_commandline_source' to '_CUST_VAR_NAME'.

ex.:

  show_full_commandline_source = check_command



==== show_long_plugin_output

When a plugin returns more than one line of output, the
output can be displayed directly in the status table, as
popup or not at all.
Choose between popup, inline and off

them on the problems page only. Use this value to force a value.

ex.:

  show_host_attempts = 1


==== perf_bar_mode
This option enables a performance bar inside the status/host list which
create a graph from the performance data of the plugin output. Available
options are 'match', 'first', 'all', 'worst' and 'off'.

 match: try to set graph which matches the output
 all: graph all performance values available
 first: graph only the first performance value
 worst: graph only the graph for the worst state
 off: graph no value at all

ex.:

  perf_bar_mode = match


==== perf_bar_pnp_popup
Show pnp popup if performance data are available and
pnp is used as graph engine.

ex.:

  perf_bar_pnp_popup = 1


==== shown_inline_pnp
Show inline pnp graph if available. If a service or host has a
pnp4nagios action or notes url set. Thruk will show a inline graph on the
extinfo page.
This works for /pnp4nagios/ urls and /pnp/.

ex.:

  shown_inline_pnp = 1



==== show_custom_vars
Show custom vars in host / service ext info. List variable names to
display in the host and service extinfo details page. Can be specified
more than once to define multiple variables. You may use html in your
variables. Use * as wildcard, ex.: _VAR*

ex.:

  show_custom_vars = _VAR1


==== show_error_reports
Show link to bug reports when internal errors occur.
Set to 'server' to log js error server side.

ex.:
  show_error_reports = 1


==== skip_js_errors
don't report some known harmless javascript errors

ex.:
  skip_js_errors  = cluetip is not a function

==== strict_passive_mode

Normally passive checks would be marked as disabled. With this
option set, disabled checks will only be displayed as disabled if their
last result was active. Otherwise they would be marked as passive
checks. This option also changes the passive icon only to be shown
when the last check was passive, otherwise the disabled icon will be
displayed.

ex.:

  strict_passive_mode = 1


==== sitepanel
The sitepanel is used to display multiple backends/sites at a glance.
With than 10 or more sites, the list of backends will be combined
into the combined site panel which just displays the totals of
available / down / disabled sites.
Set sitepanel to list/compact/auto/off to change the default
behavior.

ex.:

  sitepanel = auto





=== Connection Settings

==== check_local_states
Get the status for remote backends from local instances. This can
increase performance when using multiple remote sites. It is enabled
by default when using more than one site. You have to define
hostchecks in any local backend (using unix sockets) with a name or
alias of the address of your remote backends.

ex.:

  check_local_states = 1


==== backend_debug
Set logging of backend in verbose mode. This only
makes sense when debug logging is activated.

ex.:

  backend_debug = 1


==== connection_pool_size
Use connection pool when accessing multiple sites.
Increases the performance because backends will be queried
parallel but uses around 50mb of memory per pool member.
Disabled when set to 0. (experimental feature)

ex.:

  connection_pool_size = 0


==== logcache
Enables caching logfiles for faster access and less memory usage for
the nagios process. Cache supports MongoDB and Mysql only. Prefered
type is Mysql. Format is a Mysql/MongoDB connection string like
'mysql://hostname:port/db'. Using a cache dramatically decreases cpu and
memory usage of Thruk and Nagios when accessing logfiles, for example when
creating reports.

ex.:

  logcache = mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/thruk_log_cache

  logcache = mongodb://localhost:27017/thruk_log_cache


==== delay_pages_after_backend_reload

Delay the page delivery until the backends uptime is at least this
amount of seconds. Displaying pages soon after backend restarts
may display wrong results and all services are pending. Enable this if
you experience problems with pending services after reloading your
backend.
Should be obsolete with Livestatus versions greater than 1.2
ex.: setting this to 10 would start serving pages 10 seconds
after the backend reload

ex.:

  delay_pages_after_backend_reload = 10


==== ssl_verify_hostnames

Can be set to enable / disable hostname verification for https connections. For
example for the cookie login or the http backend.

ex.:

  ssl_verify_hostnames = 1


==== use_curl

Enable curl library to speed up http connections, for example used by
the HTTP backend provider. Disabled by default.

ex.:

  use_curl = 1





=== Cookie Authentication Settings

==== cookie_auth_login_url

too.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_login_url = thruk/cgi-bin/login.cgi


==== cookie_auth_restricted_url
Specifies the url against the cookie auth provider will verify its
credentials.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_restricted_url = http://localhost/thruk/cgi-bin/restricted.cgi


==== cookie_auth_session_timeout
Specifies the timeout for idle sessions.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_session_timeout       = 86400


==== cookie_auth_session_cache_timeout
Specifies the amount of seconds in which subsequent requests won't
verify authentication again.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_session_cache_timeout = 5


==== cookie_auth_domain

Cookie domain is usually set automatically. Use this option
to override the default value. Domains have to contain at least
two periods. Useful for single sign on environments.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_domain = .domain.com


==== cookie_auth_login_hook

Hook script which is called on every successful login. The REMOTE_USER
environment variable will be set to the username of the current logged
in user. Useful to do magic stuff on each login.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_login_hook = ./bin/hook.sh





=== Command Settings

==== cmd_defaults
Set the default checked state for command options.

ex.:

  <cmd_defaults>
    ahas                   = 0  # For Hosts Too
    broadcast_notification = 0  # Broadcast
    force_check            = 0  # Forced Check
    force_notification     = 0  # Forced Notification
    send_notification      = 1  # Send Notification
    sticky_ack             = 1  # Sticky Acknowledgement
    persistent_comments    = 1  # Persistent Comments
    persistent_ack         = 0  # Persistent Acknowledgement Comments
    ptc                    = 0  # For Child Hosts Too
    use_expire             = 0  # Use expire time ( for cores which support it)
  </cmd_defaults>


==== downtime_duration
Default duration of new downtimes in seconds. Default is 2 hours.

ex.:

  downtime_duration = 7200


==== expire_ack_duration
Default duration of acknowledgements with expire date. Default is one
day.

ex.:

  expire_ack_duration = 86400



==== cmd_quick_status
Configure which commands should be available as quick status commands.

ex.:

  <cmd_quick_status>
    reschedule             = 0  # Reschedule next check
    downtime               = 0  # Add/remove downtimes
    comment                = 0  # Add/remove comments
    acknowledgement        = 0  # Add/remove acknowledgements
    active_checks          = 0  # Enable/disable active checks
    notifications          = 0  # Enable/disable notifications
    submit_result          = 0  # Submit passive check result
    reset_attributes       = 0  # Reset modified attributes
  </cmd_quick_status>



==== command_reschedule_alias
When you want to reschedule passive checks for which the result is fetched by
an agent (For example check_mk or some scenarios of check_multi). You
usually want to reschedule the agent instead of the passive check.

The command reschedule alias can be used to translate the reschedule command
from the passive service to the active agent service.

  command_reschedule_alias = pattern;master_service_description

.Notes
* The pattern will be tested against the service description and the command_name
  of the passive check.
* The resulting service name be on the same host and the contact must
  be authorized for that service too.
* The pattern must be a valid perl regular expression.
* Duplicates  will be removed. So if you reschedule 10 services which result in
  the same master service will only trigger one reschedule.
* Only passive services will be translated

In this example, all passive check_mk checks will trigger the active agent check
and therefor allow you to reschedule passive checks directly from the problems
page.

ex.:

  command_reschedule_alias = ^check_mk\-(?!inventory);Check_MK


==== use_wait_feature
Waiting is a livestatus feature. When enabled, Thruk will wait
after rescheduling hosts/services checks until the
check has been really executed up to a maximum of 10 seconds. Adjust
the time waiting with the 'wait_timeout' option.

ex.:

  use_wait_feature = 1


==== wait_timeout
Amount of seconds to wait until a rescheduled check finishes. Thruk
will wait this amount and display the result immediately.

ex.:

  wait_timeout = 10





=== Cron Settings


==== cron_file
Specify a file which is then completely under the control of Thruk.
It will be used to store cronjobs, ex. for reports. The file has to be
writable by Thruk.

ex.:

  cron_file = /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


==== cron_pre_edit_cmd
The pre edit cmd can be used to do run a command just before Thruk
will edit the crontab.

ex.:

  cron_pre_edit_cmd  = /usr/bin/crontab -l > /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


==== cron_post_edit_cmd
The post edit cmd is necessary for OMD where you need to reload the
crontab after editing or for replacing the users cron with the edited
file.

ex.:

  cron_post_edit_cmd = crontab /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


==== thruk_bin
Path to your thruk executable. Will be used in cronjobs.

ex.:

  thruk_bin = /usr/bin/thruk





=== Icinga Settings

==== enable_icinga_features
This one activates all icinga specific features.
If not set, Thruk will try to auto-detect your backends.
Currently auto detection will only work within OMD. Don't enable it
unless all your backends are icinga.

ex.:

  enable_icinga_features = 1





=== Shinken Settings

==== enable_shinken_features
This one activates all problem/impact and criticity features.
Currently it will only work with shinken backends. Don't enable it
unless all your backends are shinken.
If not set, it will be automatically enabled when using only
shinken backends.

ex.:

  enable_shinken_features = 1


==== priorities
Set the names of the priority (criticity in shinken). Currently this
will only work with shinken backends.

ex.:

  <priorities>
    5   = Business Critical
    4   = Top Production
    3   = Production
    2   = Standard
    1   = Testing
    0   = Development
  </priorities>





=== Other Settings

==== no_external_job_forks
Normally reports will be generated in an external process to avoid
timeouts on long running reports. Use this switch to turn external
jobs off and generate reports directly. Make sure they are finished
within 40seconds which is the default fcgi timeout.

ex.:

  no_external_job_forks = 1



==== thruk_init
Path to your thruk init script. Will be used to restart thruk.

ex.:

  thruk_init = /etc/init.d/thruk


==== cookie_path

Path used for cookies. Do not change unless you have weird url
rewrites which breaks setting cookies.

                 may add multiple groups separated by comma. Users
                 without the right contactgroup don't even see
                 that there is a backend. Note that this implies
                 one extra backend request per page.
     ** section  to group backends/sites by different sections, enter a

    <peer>
        name   = Local Nagios
        type   = livestatus
        hidden = 1             # makes this backend hidden by default

       </options>
    </peer>
  </Component>





=== Component Thruk::Plugin::ConfigTool

Enable config tool by setting path to different components config
files. Users with the roles 'authorized_for_configuration_information'
and 'authorized_for_system_commands' will then have access to the
config tool.
You don't have to restart Thruk when changing the config with the
config tool.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::ConfigTool>
    show_plugin_syntax_helper = 1
    thruk                     = .../thruk_local.conf
    cgi.cfg                   = .../cgi.cfg
    htpasswd                  = .../htpasswd
  </Component>


==== show_plugin_syntax_helper

Enable/Disable the plugin syntax helper. When enabled, Thruk will
run the plugins with "plugin -h" to get the help information.

==== thruk
Path to your thruk_local.conf. Enables adjusting Thruks config if set.

==== cgi.cfg
Path to your cgi.cfg. Enables adjusting the cgi.cfg if set.

==== htpasswd
Path to your htpasswd. Enables user management based an Apaches basic auth with htpasswd.





=== Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama

The 'Panorama' plugin is a nice, fully customizable dashboard allowing
you to build your own panorama views.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
    state_provider  = server
    default_view    = /var/lib/thruk/default_panorama_view
  </Component>


==== state_provider
Sets the way states between reloads are preserved.
Valid options are 'cookie' or 'server'. Cookie store is useful for demo systems
where lot people share the same account.

==== default_view
Can be either the string of an exported view or path to a file with exported view.





=== Component Thruk::Plugin::Reports2

The 'Reports2' plugin creates sla reports in html or pdf format. You
probably have to download the wkhtmltopdf binary in a recent version.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Reports2>
    report_nice_level = 5
    report_base_url   = http://host.local/thruk/cgi-bin/
    wkhtmltopdf       = /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf
    pnp_export        = plugins/plugins-enabled/reports2/script/pnp_export.sh
    report_from_email = User Name <example@mail.com>
  </Component>

==== report_nice_level
Execute regular scheduled reports with this nice level.

==== report_base_url
Url used to replace relative links in html reports.

==== wkhtmltopdf
wkhtmltopdf is used to convert html pages into pdf. You will need
at least version 0.11. Get wkhtmltopdf from http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/

==== pnp_export
pnp_export defines a script which exports a PNP4nagios graph into a
local file which then can be included in reports. PNP4nagios images
are either exported localy by executing php or remotly fetched with
wget. This works automatically in OMD, but only for local sites of
course. To make this work without OMD, set the variable 'PNP_ETC' and
'PNP_INDEX' in the ~/.thruk file of your webserver. The PNP4nagios url
is taken from the action url or from the notes url.

ex.:

  export PNP_ETC="/etc/pnp4nagios"
  export PNP_INDEX="/usr/share/pnp4nagios/htdocs/index.php"

Remote PNP4nagios graphs will be fetched by wget and usually the
graphs are password protected, so you may want to set a different wget
command to specify a username and password. This can to be set by the
'PNP_WGET' variable in the ~/.thruk file of the webserver user. You
may force to use wget by setting 'PNP_URL_PREFIX'.

ex.:

  export PNP_WGET="wget -q --user=admin --password=secret"
  export PNP_URL_PREFIX="http://demo.thruk.org"


==== report_from_email

Set the from address used in e-mail reports.
Format is "User Name <example@mail.com>"

=== Component Thruk::Plugin::Statusmap

The Statusmap plugin gives an overview over your network.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Statusmap>
    statusmap_default_groupby = address
    statusmap_default_type    = table
  </Component>


==== statusmap_default_type
You may change the default map type of the statusmap here. Valid
types are: 'table' and 'circle'


==== statusmap_default_groupby
And the statusmap default group by which has to be one of:
'parent', 'address', 'domain', 'hostgroup', 'servicegroup'



=== User & Group Specific Overrides
Both, the 'Users' and the 'Groups' directive override default settings for
single users or groups. In theory it's possible to override each and every
config setting from the thruk.conf but you will get funny results if you
override fundamental settings like backends, paths and such things.

==== Groups
The groups directive overrides specific config settings for one group only.
Group overrides are applied in alphabetical order. For example, if you have
a user in group 'Admins' and in 'Superadmins', he will get all overrides from
both groups, but the 'Admins' overrides will be superseded by the 'Superadmins'.

ex.:

...................................
    # disable all commands, except reschedule for all users
    command_disabled = 0-6,8-95,97-999

    <Group admins>
        # enable commands for admins again
        command_disabled =
    </Group>
...................................


==== Users
The users directive overrides specific config settings for one user only.

ex.:

...................................
    <User guest>
        # override single configuration item
        show_error_reports  = 0
        can_submit_commands = 0

        # also available for nested components
        <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
          state_provider  = server
          default_view    = /etc/thruk/default_panorama_view_guest
        </Component>
    </User>
...................................





=== cgi.cfg

The cgi.cfg is mainly the same as in Nagios or Icinga but not all
values are used.


==== show_context_help
Displays an icon with context specific help on most pages.

ex.:

  show_context_help = 1


==== use_authentication
Determines whether to use authentication or not. If enabled, Thruk will
use the REMOTE_USER from the apache environment as authenticated user
name. So the authentication has to be done by the webserver.
Authorization is done by Thruk.

ex.:

  use_authentication = 1


==== use_ssl_authentication
If enabled, the authenticated username is taken from the
SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN environment instead of the remote user.

ex.:

  use_ssl_authentication = 1


==== default_user_name
The default user will be used if no username has been provided by the
webserver. You don't have to set a default user.

ex.:

  default_user_name = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_system_information
List of usernames who have access to the system and process
information pages.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_system_information = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_configuration_information
List of usernames who have access to the configuration
information pages.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_configuration_information = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_system_commands
List of usernames who are allowed to send system commands.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_system_commands = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_services
List of usernames who are authorized to view all services.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_services = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_hosts
List of usernames who are authorized to view all hosts.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_hosts = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_service_commands
List of usernames who are authorized to send commands for all
services.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_service_commands = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_host_commands
List of usernames who are authorized to send commands for all
hosts.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_host_commands = thrukadmin


==== refresh_rate
Number of seconds after which most pages are refreshed automatically.

ex.:

  refresh_rate = 90


==== escape_html_tags
Determines whether html output from plugins is escaped or not.

ex.:

  escape_html_tags = 1


==== action_url_target
Sets the target of the action url links.

ex.:

  action_url_target = _blank


==== notes_url_target
Sets the target of the notes url links.

ex.:

  notes_url_target = _blank


==== lock_author_names
If enabled, user are not allowed to change the author name for
commands.

ex.:

  lock_author_names = 1



== Logfiles

Logging configuration takes place in the log4perl.conf. You can do whatever is
possible in log4perl. Refer to the log4perl manual for detailed
information:
http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl/Config.html
There is a log4perl.conf.example file shipped with the package.

ex.:

 log4perl.logger=ALL, ErrorLog, DebugLog
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog=Log::Dispatch::File
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.filename=/home/thruk/Thruk/logs/error.log
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.mode=append
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.Threshold=ERROR
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.layout=Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.layout.ConversionPattern=[%d][%H][%p][%c] %m%n


[TIP]
.command logging
=======
if you want to log all sent commands, just set the loglevel to INFO.

ex.: log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.Threshold=INFO
=======



== Menu Configuration

Navigation configuration is split in two files

 * menu.conf
 * menu_local.conf

The menu.conf contains the default side menu configuration. Do not change
it as this file will be overwritten with every update. If you want to
create a complete custom navigation, just copy this file to
menu_local.conf and adjust it to your needs. See the next chapter on
how to add just add a few links without having to copy the complete
file.

The menu_local.conf contains the user configuration for the side menu. See the
http://www.thruk.org/faq.html#_how_to_change_the_side_menu[FAQ] for
some examples.

The file itself is perl syntax, so you can do whatever perl can do.
Make sure you verify the syntax after changing the file. The changes
will be used immediately. So maybe you want to test your changes
on a test instance first.

[TIP]
.syntax check for menu configuration
=======
 %>perl -wc menu_local.conf
 menu_local.conf syntax OK
=======


If you just want to add a few entries, create a empty menu_local.conf
and put these lines into it:

-------
do '/usr/share/thruk/menu.conf';
insert_item('General', { 'href' => 'http://labs.consol.de', 'name' => 'Labs', target => '_blank' });
-------




== Server Side Includes

You can place static include files or executables in the ssi folder.
The static files will be place right after the body or just before the
end of the body.

IMPORTANT: This has *nothing to do* with the Apache module 'mod_include'
and just implements the nagios way of SSIs.

There are two global includes, which will be included in every cgi
page:

* ssi/common-footer.ssi
* ssi/common-header.ssi

and there are page specific includes, which will only be placed in the
specific page:

* ssi/status-footer.ssi
* ssi/status-header.ssi

Files will be statically placed inside the output of the normal cgi
output. Executables will be executed and the output will then be used
as content.

some which are only accessible by adding them directly to the url.

for a detailed description of all parameters.




== SLA Reporting

=== How it works

SLA Reporting consists of several steps.

 - report configuration
 - report template
 - converting html report into pdf
 - optionally send report by mail

==== Report Configuration

You can create and adjust report settings on the 'Reporting' page.
Make sure the plugin is enabled. After selecting a template for your
report you have to set specific types of input fields on the second
page. If you make you report public, everyone can view and refresh the
report.

==== Report Templates

All templates used for reports can be found in
'plugins/plugins-enabled/reports2/templates/reports'.
You may adjust or override all templates to your needs and put them
into a 'reports' subfolder of the 'user_template_path'.

------
  | reports     contains the selectable reports
  |- comp       contains components used in reports
  |- locale     contains localization settings
  |- style      contains css used to make reports pretty
------

See http://thruk.org/api/Thruk/Utils/Reports/Render.html for details on
available functions and examples.

==== Converting

The generated HTML report will be converted into a pdf file using wkhtml2pdf
together with xvfb. Both tools must be installed on Thruks host. There is
a binary download for wkhtml2pdf on http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/.
Use at least the 0.11 version or later.



==== Sending Reports By Mail

It's quite easy to setup sla reports by mail. All you need is to
create send option in the report configuration. It is even possible to
send one report at multiple times.


=== Customized Reports
Reports can be customized with some HTML and CSS knowledge. Reports in general
have several blocks which specify the steps done to produce the report.

  * styles
  * edit
  * prepare
  * render
  * mail

==== Styles
Customizing css styles of your reports is easy. You need to create a
new file 'reports/style/custom.tt' below your 'user_template_path'.

For example:

------
<style type="text/css">
/* override css styles */
BODY {
    font-family: arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 11px;
    line-height: 18px;
    font-size: 16px;
}
</style>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
/* add complete new elements by javascript */
  jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('<img src="[% url_prefix %]thruk/themes/Thruk/images/logo_thruk.png">').insertBefore('DIV.page.cover DIV.titletext');
  });
</script>
------

If thats not enough, you still can change each and every template used to create the reports.



==== Edit Block
The edit block contains configuration items used for this report. They create
the edit page when someone chooses to create or edit a report of this type.
Basically this block contains all required and optional fields used for this
report.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'edit' %]
  [%
    required_fields = [
        { 'host'       => [ 'Host',        'hosts',         ''              , '', 1 ] },
        { 'timeperiod' => [ 'Timeperiod',  'rptimeperiod',  'last12months'          ] },
    ];
  %]
[% END %]
------

The key in that hash defines the parameter by which that value can be accessed
later. Each field has to point to an array with at least 3 values. The required
flag is optional.

  * Name
  * Type
  * Default value
  * Required Flag



==== Prepare Block
The prepare block is used to gather data used in the report. Usually it's been
used to get availability data via livestatus or fetch events from logfiles.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'prepare' %]
  [%
    set_unavailable_states(param.unavailable);
    calculate_availability();
  %]
[% END %]
------

You may use all functions available from the http://thruk.org/api/Thruk/Utils/Reports/Render.html[Render Helper]


==== Render Block
The render block defines the layout of the report.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'render' %]
  [% PROCESS 'reports/locale/en.tt' %]
  [%
    title        = 'Hello World Report'
    subtitle     = r.name
    coverdetails = [ 'Report Timeperiod:', get_report_timeperiod(start, end, reportDateFormat),
                     'Host:', param.host,
                   ]
  %]

  [% WRAPPER 'reports/comp/report.tt' %]
    [% WRAPPER 'reports/comp/page_cover.tt' %][% END %]
    [% WRAPPER 'reports/comp/page_standard.tt' %]
      <b>hello world</b>
    [% END %]
  [% END %]
[% END %]
------

This report would contain 2 pages. First you wrap everything into the report.tt
which defines the basic report layout and contains the stylesheets.
Then you have to define some settings used by the cover page. 'r' is a reference
to the report object, in this example we just use that as subtitle. 'coverdetails'
is a list of name / value pairs used in the details list on the cover page.
Finally we wrap a 'hello world' in a standard page. The content could contain
standard HTML tags like tables and images as well.


==== Mail Block
Finally we define a mail block which is used for the mail layout if a report
is sent by e-mail.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'mail' +%]
SUBJECT: Report: [% r.name %]

Your report is attached.

[% IF r.desc %]Description: [%+ r.desc %][% END %]
[%+ END %]
------

We use the report name 'r.name' as subject and put the report description 'r.desc'
in the body.


==== Custom Perl Render Helper
You may create a Perl Module named
'Thruk::Utils::Reports::CustomRender' which will be automatically made
available to the stash, so functions from this module can be used in
the reporting templates.





== CLI Tool & Scripting

It is possible to do comprehensive scripting with Thruk. For example
set downtimes automatically, schedule reports or change the objects
of your monitoring core configuration.

See http://thruk.org/api/Thruk/Utils/CLI.html for details and examples.

There are also some scripting examples in the examples folder.

Thruk Users Guide
=================

== Introduction

Thruk is an multibackend monitoring web interface which currently
supports Nagios and Icinga using the Livestatus NEB module. It is
designed to be a "drop-in" replacement and targets covering 100% of
the original features plus additional enhancements for large
installations.

Main Features / Advantages

  * multiple backends
  * faster, no need to parse status.dat for every request
  * less cpu usage
  * display live data, no delay between core and gui
  * independant from monitoring core, can be installed on remote host
  * clusterable, can be clustered over hosts
  * change status.cgi filter inline
  * extended logfile search
  * better logging, uses log4perl (who submitted which command?)
  * valid HTML code
  * no frames ( can be reenabled for better addon integration)
  * easy to extend with plugins
  * 100% Perl (using Catalyst Framework)
  * paging ( can be disabled and customized )
  * multiple themes included
  * Excel export
  * Adjustable side menu
  * Full expanded plugin commandline for easy testing



== How it works

Thruk is written in Perl using the
http://www.catalystframework.org[Catalyst Framework]. Backend
monitoring systems will be connected with the
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Livestatus[Monitoring::Livestatus]
Perl Module. Thruk itself is running as a fastcgi process.
Availability will be calculated with
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Availability[Monitoring::Availability].
Authentication is provided by the Apache webserver (For example with
mod_auth).

== Installation

There are several ways of installing Thruk.

=== Use OMD
The easiest way of installing thruk is using OMD from
http://omdistro.org[omdistro.org].  There are Debian, Ubuntu, Centos
and Suse Packages containing preconfigured latest versions of Nagios
and Thruk. The package also includes pnp4nagios, check_mk and nagvis.
Even shinken will be part of the next release. OMD is the recommended
way of installing new Nagios / Thruk setups.

=== Use Package
Standalone installation from a tarball package should be not very
difficult:

IMPORTANT: you may need to install libgd and libxpm.

----
  %> arch=$(perl -e 'use Config; print $Config{archname}')
  %> vers=$(perl -e 'use Config; print $Config{version}')
  %> wget http://www.thruk.org/files/Thruk-0.86.1-$arch-$vers.tar.gz
  %> tar zxf Thruk-0.86.1-$arch-$vers.tar.gz
  %> cd Thruk-0.86.1
  %> ./script/thruk_server.pl
----

For the FastCGI installation follow the steps at <<_fastcgi,fastcgi installation>>.

=== Quick Installation Guide for Debian

----
1.  install debian netinst
      - minimal inst, create user thruk
2.  add "contrib non-free" to /etc/apt/sources.list
3.  #> apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi libfile-copy-recursive-perl libmodule-install-perl \
          make gcc git git-core libgd2-xpm-dev libexpat1-dev
4.  #> su - thruk
5.  %> cd /tmp
6.  %> wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/A/AP/APEIRON/local-lib-1.004009.tar.gz
7.  %> tar zxvf local-lib-1.004009.tar.gz

11. %> echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >>~/.bashrc
12. %> . ~/.bashrc
13. %> cd && git clone http://github.com/sni/Thruk.git
14. %> cd Thruk
15. %> perl Makefile.PL && make
16. %> cp thruk.conf thruk_local.conf && vi thruk_local.conf
17. %> vi cgi.cfg
18. %> ./script/thruk_server.pl
----



=== Install from Source
==== Requirements

In order to install the Thruk Monitoring Webinterface from source for Nagios/Icinga you
will need the following:

- Perl
- Git Client
- compiler tools: automake, make, g++, gcc
- Apache Webserver (optional for fastcgi only)

==== Create New User
refer to your systems manual on howto add new user.
This guide uses the following:

-------
  user:  thruk
  group: thruk
-------


IMPORTANT: all following steps should be done by the thruk user.

==== Install Local::Lib


Follow the steps on http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib#The_bootstrapping_technique

quick guide:

-------
  %> su - thruk
  %> wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/A/AP/APEIRON/local-lib-1.004009.tar.gz
  %> tar zxf local-lib-1.004009.tar.gz
  %> cd local-lib-1.004009
  %> perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap && make install
-------

[TIP]
.proxy configuration
=======
if you need a proxy configuration, you should answer <no> at this question:

 Would you like me to configure as much as possible automatically? [yes]

Setting a proper http_proxy/ftp_proxy environment should work for the automatic
configuration.
=======


Add the following line to the thruk users .profile or .bashrc

 eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)

logout and login again and verify that your perl env looks like this:

-------
 %> env | grep perl
 PERL5LIB=/home/thruk/perl5/lib/perl5:/home/thruk/perl5/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi
 MODULEBUILDRC=/home/thruk/perl5/.modulebuildrc
 PATH=/home/thruk/perl5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games
 PERL_MM_OPT=INSTALL_BASE=/home/thruk/perl5
-------


==== Install Module::Install
-------
  perl -MCPAN -e "install Module::Install::Catalyst"
-------


==== Git Clone Thruk

-------
    git clone http://github.com/sni/Thruk.git
    cd Thruk
    perl Makefile.PL
-------

press <enter> here:
-------
  ==> Auto-install the 35 mandatory module(s) from CPAN? [y]
-------

then run make
-------
    make
-------

This may take a while, as there are probably several modules missing.

Press <y> at this questions:
-------
  Do you want to build the XS Stash module? [y]
  Do you want to use the XS Stash by default? [y]
-------

Tell me if someone knows a way to answer this questions automatically.

run perl Makefile.PL again to see if all dependecies are now installed properly.

-------
    perl Makefile.PL
-------


==== Install Livestatus

Refer to http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html#H1:%20Setting%20up%20and%20using%20Livestatus
on how to install livestatus onto your monitoring box.

Basically you have to build the NDO addon and add it to your nagios/icinga.cfg.

-------
 broker_module=/opt/local/livestatus/livestatus.o /tmp/live.sock
-------


==== Configuration

Copy "thruk.conf" to "thruk_local.conf" and adjust the livestatus settings to your needs.
-------
  %> cp thruk.conf thruk_local.conf
-------
The thruk.conf will be overwritten with new defaults on updates. The
thruk_local.conf contains the local overrides and will never be
overwritten.


Edit "cgi.conf" and adjust settings to your needs.

See the <<Configuration>> section for detailed explaination of configuration options.



==== Start Server
After running these steps successfully, you should be able to test your
installation:

-------
    ./script/thruk_server.pl
-------

Open your browser and open http://<your_host>:3000


== FastCGI

There are two fast cgi modules for apache at the moment. Choose the
one which fits best into your environment.

[TIP]
.lighthttpd
=======
Francois Ponsard wrote an article on how to integrate Thruk in Lighthttpd:
http://www.dahwa.fr/dotclear/index.php?post/2011/03/15/Thruk-in-Lighttpd
=======

=== mod_fastcgi

start your fcgi server:

-------
    %>./script/thruk_fastcgi.pl -n 5 \
                -l /tmp/thruk_fastcgi.socket \
                -p /tmp/thruk_fastcgi.pid
-------

you may want to copy the init.d script to /etc/init.d and adjust its paths:
-------
    %> sudo cp ./script/thruk_fastcgi_server.sh /etc/init.d/thruk_fastcgi_server
    %> vi /etc/init.d/thruk_fastcgi_server
    %> sudo chown root: /etc/init.d/thruk_fastcgi_server
-------

Or create a custom init.d script (additional modules required) with:
-------
    %> ./script/thruk_create.pl FastCGI::ExternalServer l=/tmp/thruk_fastcgi.socket n=5 p=/tmp/thruk_fastcgi.pid
-------



==== Apache Configuration

use this apache example configuration:

- replace /home/thruk/Thruk with your installation path
- replace your-web-host.local with your hostname
- create a /home/thruk/Thruk/htpasswd.users with htpasswd2
- make sure the /home/thruk/Thruk/logs/ directory exists


.Apache configuration within existing vhost

== Configuration

Configuration is managed mainly in these configuration files.

  * thruk.conf
  * thruk_local.conf
  * cgi.cfg
  * log4perl.conf
  * menu.conf
  * menu_local.conf


=== thruk.conf

The thruk.conf contains the shipped defaults. You should not edit this
file directly. Overwrite your settings in your thruk_local.conf
instead.


=== thruk_local.conf

The thruk_local.conf is a copy of the thruk.conf. Both files are used by thruk.
The idea is, that the thruk.conf is provided with the packaged defaults and the
thruk_local.conf is to override these settings where needed.


==== use_timezone

Changes the timezone from the systems default to this timezone.
Only set this if you have trouble with displaying the right timestamps.

ex.:

  use_timezone = CET


==== title_prefix

set the title prefix for all urls
this piece of text will be prepended to
all page titles.

ex.:

  title_prefix = Prod


==== url_prefix

Changes the usual url path for Thruk. Don't change it unless you plan
to run multiple Thruk instances on the same webserver. You will have
to change your fastcgi configuration too.

ex.:

  url_prefix = /


==== use_strict_host_authorization

When set to a true value, every contact will only see the hosts where
he is contact for plus the services where he is contact for. When
disabled, a host contact will see all services for this host
regardless of wheter he is a service contact or not.

ex.:

  use_strict_host_authorization = 1


==== start_page

This link is used as startpage and points usually to the main.html
with displays version information and general links.

ex.:

  start_page = /thruk/main.html


==== documentation_link

This link is used in the side navigation menu as link to the documentation.
Replace it with whatever your documentation is located. Set it to a blank value
if you don't want a documentation link in the menu at all.

ex.:

  documentation_link = /thruk/docs/


==== all_problems_link

Customizable link for the "problems" link in side menu. Can be useful
to reflect your companys process of error handling.

ex.:

  all_problems_link = /thruk/cgi-bin/status.cgi?...


==== allowed_frame_links

List of allowed patterns, where links inside frames can be set to.
You can link to /thruk/frame.html?link=http://wiki.my-company.com/page/blah
Your wiki will then be displayed with the Thruk navigation frame.
Useful for other addons, so they don't have to display a own
navigation.

ex.:

  allowed_frame_links = http://intranet.my-company.com
  allowed_frame_links = https://wiki.my-company.com


==== cgi_cfg

The path to your cgi.cfg. See <<cgi.cfg>> for details.

ex.:

  cgi_cfg = cgi.cfg


==== log4perl_conf

The path to your log4perl configuration file.

ex.:

  log4perl_conf = ./log4perl.conf


==== plugin_path

Path to your plugins directory. Can be used to specify different
location for you Thruk plugins. Don't forget to set appropriate apache
alias or rewrite rules when changing the plugin path. Otherwise the
static content from plugins is not accessible.

Example redirect rule for apache:

+++++
 AliasMatch /thruk/plugins/(.*?)/(.*)$ <your-plugin-dir>/plugins/plugins-enabled/$1/root/$2
+++++

ex.:

  plugin_path = ./plugins


==== tmp_path

Path to a temporary directory. Defaults to /tmp if not set and usually
this is a good place.

ex.:

  tmp_path = /tmp


==== ssi_path

The path to your ssi (server side includes) files. See
<<_server_side_includes,Server Side Includes>> for details.

ex.:

  ssi_path = ssi/


==== user_template_path

Specify a additional directory for user supplied templates. This makes
it easy to override thruks own templates.
Template search order is:

 * users template path
 * plugins template path
 * themes template path
 * thruks template path

ex.:

  user_template_path = ./my_templates


==== delay_pages_after_backend_reload

Delay the page delivery until the backends uptime is at least this
amount of seconds. Displaying pages soon after backend restarts
may display wrong results and all services are pending. Enable this if
you experience problems with pending services after reloading your
backend.
Should be obsolete with Livestatus versions greater than 1.1.6
ex.: setting this to 10 would start serving pages 10 seconds
after the backend reload

ex.:

  delay_pages_after_backend_reload = 10


==== use_frames

Set whether you want to use a framed navigation or not. With using frames it's
sometimes easier to include addons.
See allowed_frame_links option for how to integrate addons.

ex.:

  use_frames = 0


==== strict_passive_mode

Normally passive checks would be marked as disabled. With this
option set, disabled checks will only be displayed as disabled if their
last result was active. Otherwise they would be marked as passive
checks. This option also changes the passive icon only to be shown
when the last check was passive, otherwise the disabled icon will be
displayed.

ex.:

  strict_passive_mode = 1


==== use_new_search

Use the old or the classic search from the navigation. The new search
supports regular expressions and searches in many attributes. For
example: plugin_output, groups, names, descriptions

ex.:

  use_new_search = 1


==== use_ajax_search

Enables the ajax search field. There will be suggestions while typing
into the search field.

ex.:

  use_ajax_search = 1


==== ajax_search_hosts

Enables the suggestion of hosts in the ajax search field.
Depending on the number of hosts, this can make the search slow.

ex.:

  ajax_search_hosts = 1


==== ajax_search_hostgroups

Enables the suggestion of hostgroups in the ajax search field.

ex.:

  ajax_search_hostgroups = 1


==== ajax_search_services

Enables the suggestion of services in the ajax search field.
Depending on the number of services, this can make the search slow.

ex.:

  ajax_search_services = 1


==== ajax_search_servicegroups

Enables the suggestion of servicegroups in the ajax search field.

ex.:

  ajax_search_servicegroups = 1


==== default_theme

Default theme to use for all users. Must be a valid subdirectory in
the themes folder.

ex.:

  default_theme = Classic


==== use_pager
Using the pager will make huge pages much faster as most people don't want a
services page with 100.000 services displayed. Can be disabled if you don't
need it.

ex.:

  use_pager = 1


==== paging_steps
Define the selectable paging steps. Use the * to set the default
selected value.

ex.:

  paging_steps = *100, 500, 1000, all


==== group_paging_overview
Just like the paging_steps, but only for the groups overview page.

ex.:

  group_paging_overview =  *3,  10, 100, all


==== group_paging_summary
Just like the paging_steps, but only for the groups summary page.

ex.:

  group_paging_summary = *10, 50, 100, all


==== group_paging_grid
Just like the paging_steps, but only for the groups grip page.

ex.:

  group_paging_grid = *5,  10, 50,  all


==== can_submit_commands
Set this if a contact should be allowed to send commands unless defined for the
contact itself. This is the default value for all contacts unless the user has
a can_submit_commands setting in your monitoring configuration.

ex.:

  can_submit_commands = 1


==== command_disabled
Use this to disabled specific commands. Can be use multiple times to disabled
multiple commands. Use the number from the cmd_typ cgi parameter.

ex.:

  command_disabled = 14
  command_disabled = 35


==== cmd_defaults
Set the default checked state for command options.

ex.:

  <cmd_defaults>
    ahas                   = 0  # For Hosts Too
    broadcast_notification = 0  # Broadcast
    force_check            = 0  # Forced Check
    force_notification     = 0  # Forced Notification
    send_notification      = 1  # Send Notification
    sticky_ack             = 1  # Sticky Acknowledgement
    persistent_comments    = 1  # Persistent Comments
    persistent_ack         = 0  # Persistent Acknowledgement Comments
    ptc                    = 0  # For Child Hosts Too
  </cmd_defaults>


==== cmd_quick_status
Configure which commands should be available as quick status commands.

ex.:

  <cmd_quick_status>
    reschedule             = 0  # Reschedule next check
    downtime               = 0  # Add/remove downtimes
    comment                = 0  # Add/remove comments
    acknowledgement        = 0  # Add/remove acknowledgements
    active_checks          = 0  # Enable/disable active checks
    notifications          = 0  # Enable/disable notifications
    submit_result          = 0  # Submit passive check result
  </cmd_quick_status>


==== datetime_format
Default timeformat. Use POSIX format.

ex.:

  datetime_format = %Y-%m-%d  %H:%M:%S


==== datetime_format_long
Default long timeformat.

ex.:

  datetime_format_long = %a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y


==== datetime_format_log
Default log timeformat.

ex.:

  datetime_format_log = %B %d, %Y  %H


==== datetime_format_trends
Default trends timeformat.

ex.:

  datetime_format_trends = %a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y


==== datetime_format_today
Default timeformat for todays date. Can be useful if you want a
shorter date format for today.

ex.:

  datetime_format_today = %H:%M:%S


==== info_popup_event_type
On which event should the comments / downtime or longpluginout popup
show up. Valid values are onclick or onmouseover.

ex.:

  info_popup_event_type = onmouseover


==== info_popup_options
Options for the popup window used for long pluginoutput, downtimes and
comments.
See http://www.bosrup.com/web/overlib/?Command_Reference for
what options are available

ex.:

  info_popup_options = STICKY,CLOSECLICK,HAUTO,MOUSEOFF


==== show_notification_number
Display the current number of notification after the current / max
attempts on the status details page.

ex.:

  show_notification_number = 0


==== show_full_commandline
Display the full command line for host / service checks .
Be warned, the command line could contain passwords and other confidential data.
In order to replace the user macros for commands, you have to set the
'resource_file' in your peer config or the general 'resource_file' option.

 * 0 = off, don't show the command line at all
 * 1 = show them for contacts with the role: authorized_for_configuration_information
 * 2 = show them for everyone

ex.:

  show_full_commandline = 0


==== resource_file
Set a general resource file. Make sure it does not contain any
passwords or any other data which should not be displayed. Instead of
using a general 'resource_file' you could define one file per peer in your
peer config.

ex.:

  resource_file = /etc/nagios3/resource.cfg



==== shown_inline_pnp
Show inline pnp graph if available. If a service or host has a
pnp4nagios action url set, Thruk will show a inline graph on the
extinfo page.

ex.:

  shown_inline_pnp = 1



==== statusmap_default_type
You may change the default map type of the statusmap here. Valid 
types are: 'table' and 'circle'

ex.:

  statusmap_default_type = table


==== statusmap_default_groupby
And the statusmap default group by which has to be one of:
'parent', 'address', 'domain', 'hostgroup', 'servicegroup'

ex.:

  statusmap_default_groupby = address


==== enable_shinken_features
This one activates all problem/impact and criticity features.
Currently it will only work with shinken backends. Dont enable it
unless all your backends are shinken.
If not set, it will be automatically enabled when using only
shinken backends.

ex.:

  enable_shinken_features = 1



==== check_local_states
Get the status for remote backends from local instances. This can
increase performance when using multiple remote sites. It is enabled
by default when using more than one site. You have to define
hostchecks in any local backend (using unix sockets) with a name or
alias of the address of your remote backends.

ex.:

  check_local_states = 1



==== Component Thruk::Backend
Enter your backend connection settings here. At the moment only
livestatus is supported. The port is the port from the
xinetd.conf. You can enter local unix sockets too.

  * peer             enter the peer configuration. You have to enter a name for
                     each peer.
         - name      name for this connection
         - type      type of this connection. Only "livestatus" possible at the
                     moment
         - hidden    should this peer be hidden initially ( can be reenabled
                     via gui switch ) Only useful with more than one
                     backend.
         - groups    if set, only contacts from these groups have access. You
                     may add multiple groups seperated by comma. Users
                     without the right contactgroup don't even see
                     that there is a backend. Note that this implies
                     one extra backend request per page.

=== cgi.cfg

The cgi.cfg is mainly the same as in Nagios or Icinga itself stripped
down some unneeded values.


==== show_context_help
Displays an icon with context specific help on most pages.

ex.:

  show_context_help = 1


==== use_authentication
Determines whether to use authentication or not. If enabled, Thruk will
use the REMOTE_USER from the apache environment as authenticated user
name. So the authentication has to be done by the webserver.
Authorization is done by Thruk.

ex.:

  use_authentication = 1


==== use_ssl_authentication
If enabled, the authenticated username is taken from the
SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN environment instead of the remote user.

ex.:

  use_ssl_authentication = 1


==== default_user_name
The default user will be used if no username has been provided by the
webserver. You don't have to set a default user.

ex.:

  default_user_name = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_system_information
List of usernames who have access to the system and process
information pages.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_system_information = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_configuration_information
List of usernames who have access to the configuration
information pages.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_configuration_information = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_system_commands
List of usernames who are allowed to send system commands.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_system_commands = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_services
List of usernames who are authorized to view all services.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_services = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_hosts
List of usernames who are authorized to view all hosts.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_hosts = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_service_commands
List of usernames who are authorized to send commands for all
services.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_service_commands = thrukadmin


==== authorized_for_all_host_commands
List of usernames who are authorized to send commands for all
hosts.
You may use wildcards here.

ex.:

  authorized_for_all_host_commands = thrukadmin


==== refresh_rate
Number of seconds after which most pages are refreshed automatically.

ex.:

  refresh_rate = 90


==== escape_html_tags
Determines whether html output from plugins is escaped or not.

ex.:

  escape_html_tags = 1


==== action_url_target
Sets the target of the action url links.

ex.:

  action_url_target = _blank


==== notes_url_target
Sets the target of the notes url links.

ex.:

  notes_url_target = _blank


==== lock_author_names
If enabled, user are not allowed to change the author name for
commands.

ex.:

  lock_author_names = 1



=== log4perl.conf

This file contains the log4perl configuration. You can configure whatever is
possible in log4perl. Refer to the log4perl manual for detailed
information:
http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl/Config.html
There is a log4perl.conf.example file shiped with the package.

ex.:

 log4perl.logger=ALL, ErrorLog, DebugLog
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog=Log::Dispatch::File
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.filename=/home/thruk/Thruk/logs/error.log
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.mode=append
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.Threshold=ERROR
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.layout=Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
 log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.layout.ConversionPattern=[%d][%H][%p][%c] %m%n


[TIP]
.command logging
=======
if you want to log all sent commands, just set the loglevel to INFO.

ex.: log4perl.appender.ErrorLog.Threshold=INFO
=======




=== menu.conf

This file contains the default side menu configuration. Do not change
it. If you want to change the configuration copy this file to
menu_local.conf and change that file.




=== menu_local.conf

This file contains the user configuration for the side menu. The file
is not shipped with the Thruk package. Just copy the menu.conf to
menu_local.conf to create it.

The file itself is perl syntax, so you can do whatever perl can do.
Make sure you verify the syntax after changing the file. The changes
will be used immediately. So maybe you want to test your changes
on a test instance first.

[TIP]
.syntax check for menu configuration
=======
 %>perl -wc menu_local.conf
 menu_local.conf syntax OK
=======






=== Server Side Includes

You can place static include files or executables in the ssi folder.
The static files will be place right after the body or just before the
end of the body. 

IMPORTANT: This has *nothing to do* with the Apache module 'mod_include'
and just implements the nagios way of SSIs.

There are two global includes, which will be included in every cgi
page:

* ssi/global-footer.ssi
* ssi/global-header.ssi

and there are page specific includes, which will only be placed in the
specific page:

* ssi/status-footer.ssi
* ssi/status-header.ssi

Files will be statically placed inside the output of the normal cgi
output. Executables will be executed and the output will then be used
as content.



== Examples

Here is a list of common tasks and configurations.

=== Remote Livestatus with SSL

IMPORTANT: unfortunately this does not work with latest Thruk
versions. Socat somehow disconnects after a few packets. Please use
stunnel or ssh with the usual xinetd configuration.

Generate ssl key for the remote machine:

---------------------
  %> FILENAME=remote-livestatus
  %> openssl genrsa -out $FILENAME.key 1024
  %> openssl req -new -key $FILENAME.key -x509 -days 3653 -out $FILENAME.crt
  %> cat $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.crt >$FILENAME.pem
  %> chmod 600 $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.pem
---------------------

Generate ssl key for thruk. Use the same command with a different FILENAME.
---------------------
  %> FILENAME=thruk-host
---------------------

Now start socat on both machines:

.Remote Machine
---------------------
  %> /usr/bin/socat \
       -L/tmp/liveststatus-socat.lock \
       openssl-listen:9999,reuseaddr,fork,cert=/path_to_your/certs/remote-livestatus.pem,cafile=/path_to_your/certs/thruk-host.crt,keepalive,nodelay \
       UNIX-CLIENT:/usr/local/nagios/var/live.sock,keepalive
---------------------
Socat will then listen on port 9999 and connect to the local unix socket from livestatus.
Change the paths to your needs.


Start another socat on the thruk host:
.Thruk Machine
---------------------
  %> /usr/bin/socat \
       -L/tmp/liveststatus-socat.lock \
       UNIX-LISTEN:/home/thruk/var/remote.sock,fork,keepalive,mode=0660,group=thruk \
       openssl-connect:remote-host:9999,cert=/path_to_your/certs/thruk-host.pem,cafile=/path_to_your/certs/remote-livestatus.crt
---------------------

Socat will then connect to the remote host on port 9999 and listen on the local unix socket. The tcp connection is encrypted.
You can now add the /home/thruk/var/remote.sock to your thruk_local.conf.

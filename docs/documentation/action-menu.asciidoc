= Action Menu

{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
The Action Menu is a way to create custom icons and menus for every host or
service. You may add multiple action icons or even multiple menus for each host
or service. You can then open links or trigger server actions from that menu
or icons.

== Adding an Action Menu
There are 3 ways to add an action menu to a host or service.

  * set the menu directly by the `_THRUK_ACTION_MENU` custom variable
  * reference an existing menu from the `action_menu_items` by a  `_THRUK_ACTION_MENU` custom variable
  * use apply rules from `action_menu_apply`

The are some examples in the link:configuration.html#action-menu-settings[configuration] documentation.

== Server Actions

Server Action can be triggered from icons or menu items by using a pseudo url
like this in your action urls. See the link:configuration.html#action-menu-settings[configuration]
section on how and where to set this link.

-----
    server://*scriptname*/argument1/argument2/...
-----

To make this work, you need to define that `scriptname` in your thruk_local.conf:

-----
  <action_menu_actions>
      scriptname   = /usr/local/bin/sample.sh $HOSTNAME$ $SERVICEDESC$
  </action_menu_actions>
-----

When somebody clicks on that link, Thruk will start the `sample.sh` script like:

-----
    /usr/local/bin/sample.sh <hostname> <servicename> argument1 argument2
-----

First it uses the complete commandline from the `thruk_local.conf` and replaces
all available macros. Then it adds the arguments from the link configuration.

See link:macros.html[Macros] for a list of all available macros.


=== Scripts
The scripts can do whatever they want. However you should consider a few things:

  * Make the script exit quickly. Thruk waits for the script to return. Long running
    tasks should be started in the background.
  * Give the user useful feedback on STDOUT
  * Exit codes should be zero if OK and greater than zero on errors.

[TIP]
.script output
=======
Script output will be displayed as user response which allows the script
to give feedback to the user. HTML is allowed and will be used in the output.
=======

=== Authorization
The Script will be run when ever the user has access to the given host and service.
If your script wants to do some further checking, it can use the `$REMOTE_USER$`
environment variable.



== Examples

=== Panorama Dashboard

This is a small example script which uses perl to change the color of a shaped
icon.

.icon settings

.thruk_local.conf
-----
  <action_menu_actions>
    switch_color    = .../switch_color.pl $DASHBOARD_ID$ $DASHBOARD_ICON$
  </action_menu_actions>
-----

[TIP]
.switch_color.pl
=======
just changes the color of the icon.

== Business Process

Thruk comes with a business process engine which allows you to design, operate
and illustrate your business intelligence models. It is possible to span business
prosesses across multiple sites, but the calculation will happen all in one
single local site. Thruk needs to able to access the 'check_results' folder to
submit results and a config file to create hosts and services for your objects.

In 'edit mode' nodes can be changed by right-clicking them and select
'Edit Node'. General options, like using hard or soft states can be
changed in the 'General' Tab of any node.

== How it works

.Business Process Workflow
image:source/bp_arch.png[Business Process Architecture]

 - 'Thruks Business Process Engine' is usually by cron, which is automatically
   added if you create your first business process.
 - 'Business Process Config' and 'Runtime Status' are JSON files which are used to
   store objects and status
 - Results are submited to Naemon by using the check_results folder or by livestatus.
 - 'Livestatus' will be used to fetch input data for the calculation itself.

== Setup
If you are not using OMD, you will have to do some manual steps:

 - copy the <Component Thruk::Plugin::BP> block from your
   /etc/thruk/thruk.conf into your thruk_local.conf in order to make
   some local adjustments.
 - copy the Thruk BP Templates from either
   https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/master/support/thruk_templates.cfg[github]
   or /usr/share/thruk/thruk_templates.cfg into your naemon conf.d
   folder, ex .:/etc/naemon/conf.d/thruk_bp_templates.cfg
 - change the 'objects_templates_file' to that location.
 - create an empty file thruk_bp_generated.cfg, ex.:
   /etc/naemon/conf.d/thruk_bp_generated.cfg
 - change 'objects_save_file' to that location.
 - make that file editable for the webserver/thruk user. ex.: 'chown
   www-data: /etc/naemon/conf.d/thruk_bp_generated.cfg'
 - change the 'spool_dir' to ex.: /var/naemon/rw/check_results or
   whatever your naemon 'check_result_path' points too. You could also
   reuse an existing backend by specifying 'result_backend'.
 - make sure your webserver/thruk user is allowed to write to that
   folder, ex.: 'chgrp www-data /var/naemon/rw/check_results && chmod
   g+rwx /var/naemon/rw/check_results'
 - set 'objects_reload_cmd' to  "sudo -u naemon /etc/init.d/naemon
   reload". You will need to add sudo permissions to get this working.
   ex.: put "thruk ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/naemon" in your
   /etc/sudoers.


=== Integration in Naemon
Thruk will create Hosts and Services for selected nodes of your business model.
That way it is possible to send notifications, even for sub steps of the business
process. The business process itself will be created as Naemon Host object and
all selected nodes will be created as Service objects.

To make that work, you will need 2 files:

 - Thruk BP Templates (see an https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/master/support/thruk_templates.cfg[example on github])
 - Thruk BP Objects

Both file locations can be changed in your 'thruk_local.conf'. The templates file is
user maintained, while the objects file will be overwritten by Thruk whenever
you change a business process. Also make sure Thruk is allowed to write the objects
file.

In order to make integration as simple as possible, you can only choose from
different templates which can be edited by the Thruk Config Tool or manually
in the 'objects_templates_file' file.

The name of the business process will be used as hostname, so make
sure it does not clash with existing hosts by using a uniq prefix or
something similar.

[TIP]
.notifications
=======
As each business process will result in at least one host and one
service. It is recommended to setup notifications on the service,
because the host will almost always be ok and only change the state
if some internal error happens.
=======


=== Integration in Icinga2
In order to integrate Thruk Business Processes in Icinga2 you will need a minimal
configuration like:

------
<Component Thruk::Plugin::BP>
    objects_save_file      = /etc/icinga2/conf.d/thruk_bp.conf
    objects_templates_file = /etc/icinga2/conf.d/thruk_templates.conf
    objects_save_format    = icinga2
</Component>
------

The templates file can be optained from https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/master/support/thruk_templates_icinga2.conf[github]
Make sure Thruk is able to write to the `/etc/icinga2/conf.d/thruk_bp.conf` file.



== Creating New Business Processes
In order to change or create business processes, you need these roles from the cgi.cfg.

 - authorized_for_configuration_information
 - authorized_for_system_commands

Then simply model your business process from the web gui.


== Configuration
Configuration settings are covered by the
link:configuration.html#component-thruk-plugin-bp[configuration sections].



== Custom Functions
Besides the normal functions you can write your own aggregation functions easily.
Custom functions are written in Perl and are located in the <config dir>/bp/ with
the .pm filename extension.

Example: /etc/thruk/bp/echo.pm
------
# echofunction:
#
# This function just echoes the
# provided text sample and optionally
# reverses the text.
#
# Arguments:
# arg1: Text;      text;     text that should be echoed
# arg2: Reverse;   checkbox; yes; no
# arg3: Uppercase; select;   yes; no
sub echofunction {
    my($c, $bp, $n, $args, $livedata) = @_;
    my($text, $reverse, $upper) = @{$args};
    $text = scalar reverse $text if $reverse eq 'yes';
    $text =             uc $text if $upper   eq 'yes';
    return(0, $text, $text, {});
}
------

Input arguments are:

 - $c: thruk context object containing livestatus connection pool
 - $bp: business process object
 - $node: business process node object
 - $args: array ref of arguments from the node edit dialog
 - $livestatus: optional livestatus data for all hosts and services in this business process

A custom aggregation function needs to return at least 3 values and an
optional 4th hash.

 - status code: 0 = Ok, 1 = Warning, 2 = Critical, 3 = Unknown
 - node sub label: short text used inside the node
 - textual output: text output of aggregation function with optional performance data
 - extra arguments: hash list of node attributes which will be overridden.


Arguments can be specified by comments in the perl module containing your function.
See the example above...
Each Argument requires 3 attributes which are seperated by a semicolon ;

------
# arg1: Text;      text;     text that should be echoed
------

 - Name: name of this attribute, used in the edit dialog
 - Type: can be any of 'Text', 'Select', 'Checkbox', 'Host', 'Hostgroup', 'Service', 'Servicegroup'.
 - Options: optional arguments. In case of Text used as placeholder, in case of Select
            or Checkbox used as semicolon seperated list of options.

[TIP]
.perl
=======
All custom aggregation functions have 'use warnings' and 'use strict' enabled by
default and run in 'Thruk::BP::Functions' context, means they have access to all
normal aggregation functions and helpers from link:../api/Thruk/BP/Functions.html

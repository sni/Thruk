== Thruk Clustering
{% include new_since.ad version="2.24" %}
Clustered setups provide high-availability and performance improvements at the
price of higher complexity. All Thruk nodes in a cluster must use shared
storage for their `etc_path` and `var_path` while the `tmp_path` should remain
local.


=== Setup

    - Create shared storage for `etc_path` and `var_path`
    - Setup a load balancer
    - Double check the node url in `cluster_nodes`
    - Enable cluster with `cluster_enabled=1`


==== Static Cluster
Having a fixed number of cluster nodes will be set if you configure multiple
cluster_nodes with fixed hostnames like:

    cluster_enabled = 1
    cluster_nodes = http://clusternode1/$url_prefix$/
    cluster_nodes = http://clusternode2/$url_prefix$/


==== Autoscaling / Dynamic Cluster
When having no (the default) or only one generic cluster_node url defined, Thruk
uses autoscaling / registering cluster mode and new nodes are registered
automatically when they startup.

    cluster_enabled = 1
    # optionally set generic url if the default does not work
    #cluster_nodes = http://$hostname$/$url_prefix$/


=== Features

==== Shared cronjobs
Cluster setups will share their cronjobs, so reports or scheduling recurring
downtimes will only run once in a cluster.

==== High Availability
Having more than one Thruk node with a load-balancer in front will share the
load over all nodes and will still work if at least one node is available.

===== Load Balancer Configuration
Loadbalancing is not included automatically, but you can put any loadbalancer you like in front. Use this url for heartbeats to detect which cluster nodes are online.

    /thruk/cgi-bin/remote.cgi?lb_ping

If supported, you can check for the string `OK`. You can put Thruk cluster nodes in maintenance mode. In this case they will show `MAINTENANCE` instead of `OK`.

==== Maintenance

Cluster nodes can be put in maintenance mode with the cli command:

  %> thruk cluster maint

This will change the output of the url `/thruk/cgi-bin/remote.cgi?lb_ping` to `MAINTENANCE`, so if your loadbalancer is configured to match the `OK` string, it should remove the node from the active nodes.
Additionally it will return the HTTP code 503 `Service Unavailable`;

Remove the maintenance mode with the command:

  %> thruk cluster unmaint

=== Troubleshooting

    - Try to get Thruk working without cluster mode first. If that works, enable clustering.
    - You might run into issues with relative symlinks when moving etc and var onto shares. Eventually you have to link some folders to the share to make relative symlinks work again.
    - Run the command `thruk r /thruk/cluster` and `thruk r /thruk/cluster/heartbeat` to see if cluster nodes are detected correctly.

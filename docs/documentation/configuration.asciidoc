== Config Files

Configuration is managed mainly in these configuration files.

-------
  * thruk.conf          # shipped default Thruk config
  * thruk_local.conf    # local override of Thruks settings
  * cgi.cfg             # Naemon/Nagios cgi.cfg
  * log4perl.conf       # Logging configuration
  * menu.conf           # Thruks default side navigation
  * menu_local.conf     # local override for the navigation
-------


WARNING: All configuration options described in this file should go into the thruk_local.conf

=== thruk.conf

The thruk.conf contains the shipped defaults. You should not edit this
file directly. Overwrite your settings in your thruk_local.conf
instead.


=== thruk_local.conf

The thruk_local.conf is a copy of the thruk.conf. Both files are used by thruk.
The idea is, that the thruk.conf is provided with the packaged defaults and the
thruk_local.conf is to override these settings where needed.


=== cgi config

link:cgi-cfg.html[This cgi.cfg is described here].



== General Settings


=== title_prefix

set the title prefix for all urls
this piece of text will be prepended to
all page titles.

ex.:

  title_prefix = Prod


=== use_bookmark_titles

Sets the page title to the name of a bookmark
if the url matches. Private bookmarks are processed
first and the name of the first match is used.

ex.:

  use_bookmark_titles = 1


=== use_dynamic_titles

Uses more descriptive page titles.
Bookmark titles take precedence and
can be overriden by adding the title
parameter on most pages

ex.:

  use_dynamic_titles = 1


=== url_prefix

Changes the usual url path for Thruk. Don't change it unless you plan
to run multiple Thruk instances on the same webserver. You will have
to change your fastcgi configuration too.

ex.:

  url_prefix = /


=== use_timezone

Changes the timezone from the systems default to this timezone.
Only set this if you have trouble with displaying the right timestamps.

ex.:

  use_timezone = CET


=== mobile_agent
Specify user agents which will be redirected to the mobile plugin (if
enabled).

ex.:

  mobile_agent=iPhone,Android,IEMobile


=== default_theme

Default theme to use for all users. Must be a valid sub directory in
the themes folder.

ex.:

  default_theme = Thruk


=== first_day_of_week
Set first day of week. Used in reports.
 Sunday: 0
 Monday: 1

ex.:

  first_day_of_week = 0


=== report_use_temp_files
Large reports will use temp files to avoid extreme memory usage.
With 'report_use_temp_files' you may set the report duration in days
which will trigger the use of temp files. Default is 14days, so
for example the 'last31days' report will use temp files, the 'thisweek'
not. Can be disabled by setting to 0.

ex.:

  report_use_temp_files = 14


=== report_max_objects
Don't create reports with more hosts / services than this number.
The purpose is to don't wrack the server due to extended memory
usage. Increase this number if you hit that limit and have plenty
of memory left.

ex.:

  report_max_objects = 1000


=== start_page

This link is used as startpage and points usually to the main.html
with displays version information and general links.

ex.:

  start_page = /thruk/main.html


=== home_link

This link is used whenever you click on one of the main logos. By default
those logos are the Thruk logos and the link will take you to the Thruk homepage.
Replace this with where you want your home location to be.

ex.:

  home_link = http://www.thruk.org


=== documentation_link

This link is used in the side navigation menu as link to the documentation.
Replace with your documentation location. Set it to a blank value
if you don't want a documentation link in the menu at all.

ex.:

  documentation_link = /thruk/docs/


=== all_problems_link

Customizable link for the 'problems' link in side menu. Can be useful
to reflect your companies process of error handling.

ex.:

  all_problems_link = /thruk/cgi-bin/status.cgi?...


=== allowed_frame_links

List of allowed patterns, where links inside frames can be set to.
You can link to /thruk/frame.html?link=http://wiki.my-company.com/page/blah
Your wiki will then be displayed with the Thruk navigation frame.
Useful for other addons, so they don't have to display a own
navigation.

ex.:

  allowed_frame_links = http://intranet.my-company.com
  allowed_frame_links = https://wiki.my-company.com





== Authorization Settings


=== can_submit_commands
Set this if a contact should be allowed to send commands unless defined for the
contact itself. This is the default value for all contacts unless the user has
a can_submit_commands setting in your monitoring configuration.

ex.:

  can_submit_commands = 1


=== command_disabled
Use this to disabled specific commands. Can be use multiple times to disabled
multiple commands. The number can be found in the 'cmd_typ' cgi parameter from
links to the command page.
You may use ranges here.

ex.:

  command_disabled = 14
  command_disabled = 35
  command_disabled = 17-34,50-65


=== make_auth_user_lowercase

example removes everything after an @ from the authenticated username
and 'user@domain' becomes just 'user'.

ex.:

  make_auth_replace_regex = s/^(.*?)@.*/$1/gmx

=== use_strict_host_authorization

When set to a true value, every contact will only see the hosts where
he is contact for plus the services where he is contact for. When
disabled, a host contact will see all services for this host
regardless of whether he is a service contact or not.

ex.:

  use_strict_host_authorization = 1


=== csrf_allowed_hosts

Allow specific hosts to bypass the csrf protection which
requires a generated token to submit certain post requests,
for example to send commands. Use comma seperated list or
multiple configuration attributes. Wildcards are allowed.

ex.:

  csrf_allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1
  csrf_allowed_hosts=192.168.*



=== max_process_memory

Thruk process will exit after finishing its request.
Only affects the fcgid daemon.

ex.:

  max_process_memory=1000



== Path Settings

=== cgi_cfg

The path to your cgi.cfg. See link:cgi-cfg.html[cgi.cfg] for details.

ex.:

  cgi_cfg = cgi.cfg


=== log4perl_conf

The path to your log4perl configuration file.

ex.:

  log4perl_conf = ./log4perl.conf


=== plugin_path

Path to your plugins directory. Can be used to specify different
location for you Thruk plugins. Don't forget to set appropriate apache
alias or rewrite rules when changing the plugin path. Otherwise the
static content from plugins is not accessible.

Example redirect rule for apache:

+++++
 AliasMatch /thruk/plugins/(.*?)/(.*)$ YOUR-PLUGIN-DIR/plugins/plugins-enabled/$1/root/$2
+++++

ex.:

  plugin_path = ./plugins


=== themes_path

Path to your themes directory. Can be used to specify different
location for you Thruk themes. Don't forget to set appropriate apache
alias or rewrite rules when changing the themes path. Otherwise the
static content from your themes may not accessible.

+++++
 Alias /thruk/themes/ YOUR-THEMES-DIR/themes/themes-enabled/
+++++

ex.:

  themes_path = ./themes


=== var_path

Path to the var directory. Thruk stores user specific date here.

ex.:

  var_path = ./var


=== tmp_path

Path to a temporary directory. Defaults to /tmp if not set and usually
this is a good place.

ex.:

  tmp_path = /tmp


=== ssi_path

The path to your ssi (server side includes) files. See
link:ssi.html[Server Side Includes] for details.

ex.:

  ssi_path = ssi/


=== user_template_path

Specify a additional directory for user supplied templates. This makes
it easy to override thruks own templates.
Template search order is:

 * users template path
 * themes template path
 * plugins template path
 * thruks template path

ex.:

  user_template_path = ./my_templates


=== logo_path_prefix

Changes the path to your logo images. Default is
$url_prefix+'thruk/themes/'+$current_theme+'/images/logos/' and
therefor relative to the current selected theme. You could set a fixed
path here.
Like usual, paths starting with a / will be absolute from your
webserver root directory. Paths starting without a / will be relative
to the cgi directory.

ex.:

  logo_path_prefix = /icons/


=== physical_logo_path

Location of your logos in your filesystem. This directory should be
mapped to your 'logo_path_prefix' directory where 'logo_path_prefix' is
the path relative to your webserver root directory and 'physical_logo_path' is
the corresponding filesystem path.

ex.:

  physical_logo_path = /usr/share/icons/


=== mode_file

Mode used when creating or saving files.

ex.:

  mode_file = 0660


=== mode_dir

Mode used when creating folders

ex.:

  mode_dir = 0770

=== resource_file
Set a general resource file.
Be warned, if any macros contain sensitive data like passwords, setting
this option could expose that data to unauthorized user. It is strongly
recommended that this option is only used if no passwords are used in
this file or in combination with the 'expand_user_macros' option which
will limit which macros are exposed to the user.
Instead of using a general 'resource_file' you could define one file
per peer in your peer config.

ex.:

  resource_file = /etc/nagios3/resource.cfg






== Search Settings

=== use_new_search

Use the old or the classic search from the navigation. The new search
supports regular expressions and searches in many attributes. For
example: plugin_output, groups, names, descriptions

ex.:

  use_new_search = 1


=== default_service_filter
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86-2" %}
The `default_service_filter` set a default service filter which is used when no
other filter is applied (except from links to hosts or groups). The filter is
negated by a leading exclamation mark. The example filters out all services starting
with "test_". You can use regular expressions. The Default is not set.

ex.:

  default_service_filter = !^test_


=== use_ajax_search

Enables the ajax search field. There will be suggestions while typing
into the search field.

ex.:

  use_ajax_search = 1


=== ajax_search_hosts

Enables the suggestion of hosts in the ajax search field.
Depending on the number of hosts, this can make the search slow.

ex.:

  ajax_search_services = 1


=== ajax_search_servicegroups

Enables the suggestion of servicegroups in the ajax search field.

ex.:

  ajax_search_servicegroups = 1


=== ajax_search_timeperiods

Enables the suggestion of timeperiods in the ajax search field.
Timeperiods will only displayed when filtering by check- or
notification period.

ex.:

  ajax_search_timeperiods = 1





== Paging Settings


=== use_pager
Using the pager will make huge pages much faster as most people don't want a
services page with 100.000 services displayed. Can be disabled if you don't
need it.

ex.:

  use_pager = 1


=== paging_steps
Define the selectable paging steps. Use the * to set the default
selected value.

ex.:

  paging_steps = *100, 500, 1000, all


=== group_paging_overview
Just like the paging_steps, but only for the groups overview page.

ex.:

  group_paging_overview =  *3,  10, 100, all

relative paths to specify completely different location.
You also may want to use 'action_pnp.png' when using pnp.
Icon can be overridden by a custom variable '_ACTION_ICON'.

ex.:

  host_action_icon = action.gif


=== service_action_icon

Change path to your service action icons. You may use
relative paths to specify completely different location.
You also may want to use 'action_pnp.png' when using pnp.
Icon can be overridden by a custom variable '_ACTION_ICON'.

ex.:

  service_action_icon = action.gif


=== initial_menu_state

Set initial menu state.

  closed  => 0
  open    => 1

ex.:

  <initial_menu_state>
    General        = 1
    Current_Status = 1

=== show_config_edit_buttons
Show links to config tool for each host / service.
You need to have the config tool plugin enabled
and you need proper permissions for the link to appear.

ex.:

  show_config_edit_buttons = 1


=== show_full_commandline

Be warned, the command line could contain passwords and other confidential data.
In order to replace the user macros for commands, you have to set the
'resource_file' in your peer config or a general resource_file option.

 * 0 = off, don't show the command line at all
 * 1 = show them for contacts with the role: authorized_for_configuration_information
 * 2 = show them for everyone

ex.:

  show_full_commandline = 0



=== show_full_commandline_source
Usually the source of your expanded check_command should
be the check_command attribute of your host / service. But under
certain circumstances you might want to use display expanded
commands from a custom variable. In this case, set
'show_full_commandline_source' to '_CUST_VAR_NAME'.

ex.:

  show_full_commandline_source = check_command



=== show_logout_button

=== shown_inline_pnp
Show inline pnp graph if available. If a service or host has a
pnp4nagios action or notes url set. Thruk will show a inline graph on the
extinfo page.
This works for /pnp4nagios/ urls and /pnp/.

ex.:

  shown_inline_pnp = 1


=== graph_word
graph_word is a regexp used to display any graph on the details page.
if a service or host has a graph url in action url (or notes url) set
it can be displayed by specifying a regular expression that always appears
in this url. You can specify multiple graph_words.

[TIP]
.pnp4nagios
=======
When using pnp4nagios, no graph_word is required, just keep it empty.
=======



sample service configuration for graphite:

.....
  define service{
    service_description   Load
    host_name             localhost
    use                   generic-service
    action_url            http://YOURGRAPHITE/render/?lineMode=connected&width=586&height=308&_salt=1355923874.899&target=cactiStyle($HOSTNAME$.$SERVICEDESC$.*)&xFormat=%25H%3A%25M&tz=Europe/Paris
    check_command         check_load
  }
.....

ex.:

  graph_word = /render/       # for graphite


[TIP]
.quotes
=======
Quotes are supported in the action_url statement, you may want to use it for special graphite function (http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/1.0/functions.html)
Do not escape double quotes here, otherwise graph won't work.
=======

=== show_custom_vars
Show custom vars in host / service ext info. List variable names to
display in the host and service extinfo details page. Can be specified
more than once to define multiple variables. You may use html in your
variables. Use * as wildcard, ex.: _VAR*

ex.:

  show_custom_vars = _VAR1


=== expand_user_macros
Expand user macros ($USERx$) for host / service commands and custom
variables. Can be specified more than once to define multiple user
macros to expand.
Be warned, some user macros can contain passwords and expanding them
could expose them to unauthorized users. Use * as wildcard, ex.: _VAR*

ex.:

  expand_user_macros = USER1
  expand_user_macros = PLUGIN*


=== show_error_reports
Show link to bug reports when internal errors occur.
Set to '1' to show a error icon which links to a error report mail.
Set to 'server' to log js error server side.
Set to 'both' to log server side but still show the icon.

ex.:
  show_error_reports = both


=== skip_js_errors
don't report some known harmless javascript errors

ex.:
  skip_js_errors  = cluetip is not a function


=== strict_passive_mode

Normally passive checks would be marked as disabled. With this
option set, disabled checks will only be displayed as disabled if their
last result was active. Otherwise they would be marked as passive
checks. This option also changes the passive icon only to be shown
when the last check was passive, otherwise the disabled icon will be
displayed.

ex.:

  strict_passive_mode = 1


=== hide_passive_icon
Normally passive checks whould be displayed with a passive icon
if their last result is passive.
With this option, passive icon will be hidden in status details.

ex.:
  hide_passive_icon = 0


=== sitepanel
The sitepanel is used to display multiple backends/sites at a glance.
With than 10 or more sites, the list of backends will be combined
into the 'compact' site panel which just displays the totals of
available / down / disabled sites. The 'compact' panel will also
automatically be used if you use sections.
With more than 50 backends, the 'collapsed' will be selected in 'auto' mode.
Set sitepanel to list/compact/collapsed/auto/off to change the default behaviour.

ex.:

  sitepanel = auto

=== apache_status

You can integrate the output of apache status into Thruk.
The following list of apache status pages will be accessible
from the performance info page. Make sure the page is
accessible from Thruk, credentials will be passed through. So
both, basic authentication or ip based authentication would be possible.
Read more about Apaches mod_status here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_status.html

ex.:

  <apache_status>
    Site        http://127.0.0.1:5000/server-status
    System      http://127.0.0.1/server-status
    Other       http://127.0.0.1/server-status
  </apache_status>




== Connection Settings

=== check_local_states
Get the status for remote backends from local instances. This can
increase performance when using multiple remote sites. It is enabled
by default when using more than one site. You have to define
hostchecks in any local backend (using unix sockets) with a name or
alias of the address of your remote backends. To explicitly connect
a host to a specific backend, set 'state_host' in that peer configuration.

ex.:

  check_local_states = 1


=== backend_debug
Set logging of backend in verbose mode. This only
makes sense when debug logging is activated.

ex.:

  backend_debug = 1


=== connection_pool_size
Use connection pool when accessing multiple sites.
Increases the performance because backends will be queried
parallel but uses around 10mb of memory per pool member.
Disabled when set to 0, number of concurrent connections otherwise.

ex.:

  connection_pool_size = 5


=== logcache
Enables caching logfiles for faster access and less memory usage for
the naemon process. Cache supports MongoDB and Mysql only. Prefered
type is Mysql. Format is a Mysql/MongoDB connection string like
'mysql://hostname:port/db'. Using a cache dramatically decreases cpu and
memory usage of Thruk and Naemon when accessing logfiles, for example when
creating reports.

ex.:

  logcache = mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/thruk_log_cache

  logcache = mongodb://localhost:27017/thruk_log_cache


=== delay_pages_after_backend_reload

Delay the page delivery until the backends uptime is at least this
amount of seconds. Displaying pages soon after backend restarts
may display wrong results and all services are pending. Enable this if
you experience problems with pending services after reloading your
backend.
Should be obsolete with Livestatus versions greater than 1.2
ex.: setting this to 10 would start serving pages 10 seconds
after the backend reload

ex.:

  delay_pages_after_backend_reload = 10


=== ssl_verify_hostnames

Can be set to enable / disable hostname verification for https connections. For
example for the cookie login or the http backend.

ex.:

  ssl_verify_hostnames = 1


=== use_shadow_naemon

Enable usage of shadownaemon. This is a daemon which shadows a remote
core via livestatus and therefor removes network latency from accessing
remote sites. It also reduces network bandwidth usage. Best used together
with the logcache. Enabled with any true value, disabled when set to '0'.
Usually the shadownaemon processes are stopped when the last thruk
process exists, this can be changed by setting this option to 'start_only'.

Default: 0

ex.:

    use_shadow_naemon=1


=== shadow_naemon_dir
Defines the folder where all shadow cores will run in. This
also defines the path to the local socket, which will be
'shadow_naemon_dir'/'peer key'/live

ex.:

    shadow_naemon_dir=/omd/sites/<site>/tmp/remotecache


=== shadow_naemon_bin
Defines the path to the shadownaemon binary.

ex.:

    shadow_naemon_bin=/omd/sites/<site>/bin/shadownaemon


== Cookie Authentication Settings

=== cookie_auth_login_url
Specifies the url where non-authenticated users will be redirected
too.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_login_url = thruk/cgi-bin/login.cgi


=== cookie_auth_restricted_url
Specifies the url against the cookie auth provider will verify its
credentials.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_restricted_url = http://localhost/thruk/cgi-bin/restricted.cgi


=== cookie_auth_session_timeout
Specifies the timeout for idle sessions.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_session_timeout       = 86400


=== cookie_auth_session_cache_timeout
Specifies the amount of seconds in which subsequent requests won't
verify authentication again. Set to zero to disable storing hashed
credentials in the filesystem and disabling revalidation of active
sessions.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_session_cache_timeout = 5


=== cookie_auth_domain

Cookie domain is usually set automatically. Use this option
to override the default value. Domains have to contain at least
two periods. Useful for single sign on environments.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_domain = .domain.com


=== cookie_auth_login_hook

Hook script which is called on every successful login. The REMOTE_USER
environment variable will be set to the username of the current logged
in user. Useful to do magic stuff on each login.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_login_hook = ./bin/hook.sh





== Command Settings

=== cmd_defaults
Set the default checked state for command options.

ex.:

  <cmd_defaults>
    ahas                   = 0  # For Hosts Too

Default duration of new downtimes in seconds. Default is 2 hours.

ex.:

  downtime_duration = 7200


=== expire_ack_duration
Default duration of acknowledgements with expire date. Default is one
day.

ex.:

  expire_ack_duration = 86400



=== cmd_quick_status
Configure which commands should be available as quick status commands.

ex.:

  <cmd_quick_status>
    reschedule             = 0  # Reschedule next check
    downtime               = 0  # Add/remove downtimes
    comment                = 0  # Add/remove comments
    acknowledgement        = 0  # Add/remove acknowledgements
    active_checks          = 0  # Enable/disable active checks
    notifications          = 0  # Enable/disable notifications
    submit_result          = 0  # Submit passive check result
    reset_attributes       = 0  # Reset modified attributes
  </cmd_quick_status>



=== command_reschedule_alias
When you want to reschedule passive checks for which the result is fetched by
an agent (For example check_mk or some scenarios of check_multi). You
usually want to reschedule the agent instead of the passive check.

The command reschedule alias can be used to translate the reschedule command
from the passive service to the active agent service.

  command_reschedule_alias = pattern;master_service_description

.Notes
* The pattern will be tested against the service description and the command_name
  of the passive check.
* The resulting service name be on the same host and the contact must
  be authorized for that service too.
* The pattern must be a valid perl regular expression.
* Duplicates  will be removed. So if you reschedule 10 services which result in
  the same master service will only trigger one reschedule.
* Only passive services will be translated

In this example, all passive check_mk checks will trigger the active agent check
and therefor allow you to reschedule passive checks directly from the problems
page.

ex.:

  command_reschedule_alias = ^check_mk\-(?!inventory);Check_MK


=== use_feature_recurring_downtime
Use recurring downtime, shows recurring downtime links.

ex.:

  use_feature_recurring_downtime = 1


=== use_feature_histogram
Use histograms, shows histogram links.

ex.:

  use_feature_histogram = 1


=== use_service_description
Use service's description instead of display name.

ex.:

  use_service_description = 1


=== use_feature_trends
Use trends, shows trend links.

ex.:

  use_feature_trends = 1


=== use_wait_feature
Waiting is a livestatus feature. When enabled, Thruk will wait
after rescheduling hosts/services checks until the
check has been really executed up to a maximum of 10 seconds. Adjust
the time waiting with the 'wait_timeout' option.

ex.:

  use_wait_feature = 1


=== wait_timeout
Amount of seconds to wait until a rescheduled check finishes. Thruk
will wait this amount and display the result immediately.

ex.:

  wait_timeout = 10





== Cron Settings


=== cron_file
Specify a file which is then completely under the control of Thruk.
It will be used to store cronjobs, ex. for reports. The file has to be
writable by Thruk.

ex.:

  cron_file = /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


=== cron_pre_edit_cmd
The pre edit cmd can be used to do run a command just before Thruk
will edit the crontab.

ex.:

  cron_pre_edit_cmd  = /usr/bin/crontab -l > /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


=== cron_post_edit_cmd
The post edit cmd is necessary for OMD where you need to reload the
crontab after editing or for replacing the users cron with the edited
file.

ex.:

  cron_post_edit_cmd = crontab /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


=== thruk_bin
Path to your thruk executable. Will be used in cronjobs.

ex.:

  thruk_bin = /usr/bin/thruk



== Action Menu Settings
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
The Action Menu is a way to create custom icons and menus for every host or service. There
are two ways to set the menu. First one is to directly assign the menu json data
into the _THRUK_ACTION_MENU custom variable of your host or service. Or you can
just put a placeholder into the _THRUK_ACTION_MENU custom variable and define the
actual menu in 'action_menu_items'. You may add multiple action icons or even
multiple menus for each host or service.

image:source/action_menu.png[Custom Action Menu]

See the link:action-menu.html[Action Menu] section from the advanced topics for
more examples and details.

=== action_menu_items
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
Defines the menu used by placeholders from the '_THRUK_ACTION_MENU' custom variable.
The menu is a key/value pair with the name and the menu description in json format.
The menu can either be a single icon/menu or a list of menus and icons.

A simple menu could look like this, note that the menu has to be in a single line
without newlines and all newlines from the example have to be removed in order
to try that. But its more readable this way. You can also use a trailing
backslash to write the menus on multiple lines.

Sample menu with two items and a seperator:

.....
{% raw %}
  {
    "icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/dropdown.png",
    "title": "sample menu",
    "menu": [
      {
        "icon":   "/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png",
        "label":  "refresh",
        "action": "server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$"
      },
      {
        "icon":   "/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/page_white_key.png",
        "label":  "example",
        "action": "server://example/$HOSTNAME$/$SERVICEDESC$"
      },
      "-",
      {
        "icon":   "/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/page_white_text.png",
        "label":  "wiki",
        "action": "http://company-wiki/pages/$HOSTNAME$"
      }
    ]
  }
{% endraw %}
.....

A menu has the following attributes:

     ** `icon`          icon for the menu itself. You can use `{% raw %}{{theme}}{% endraw %}` as placeholder in the url
                        and `{% raw %}{{remote_user}}{% endraw %}` for the user name.
     ** `title`         title of the menu, will be display on mouse over.
     ** `menu`          the actual menu definition as a list '[...]' of sub items.

A single `"-"` item can be used as a menu item seperator.


The menu item can have the following attributes:

     ** `icon`          icon for the menu item. You can use `{% raw %}{{theme}}{% endraw %}` as placeholder in the url.
     ** `label`         label name of the menu item.
     ** `action`        url or action which will be run or openend. This can either be a
                        http(s) link or a serveraction in the form server://actionname/argument1/argument2/...
                        the actionname must be a reference to a command from 'action_menu_actions'.
     ** `target`        Use '_blank' here to open link in a new window.

Sample icons with two action icons:

.....
{% raw %}
  [
    {
      "icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/criticity_1.png",
      "action":"http://splunk/abc/hostid=$_HOSTHOSTID$",
      "target":"_blank"
    },
    {
      "icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png",
      "action":"server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$",
    }
  ]
{% endraw %}
.....


Variant 1 - reference to a pre defined menu:

.....
{% raw %}
  *thruk_local.conf:*

    <action_menu_items>
        standardmenu      = {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/dropdown.png",\
                             "title": "test title",\
                             "menu":[\
                                {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png",\
                                 "label":"refresh",\
                                 "action":"server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$"}\
                             ]\
                            }
    </action_menu_items>

  *host.cfg:*

    define host {
      host_name            localhost
      ...
      _THRUK_ACTION_MENU   standardmenu
    }
{% endraw %}
.....


Variant 2 - define the menu in object config only:

.....
{% raw %}
  *host.cfg:*

    define host {
      host_name            localhost
      ...
      _THRUK_ACTION_MENU   {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/dropdown.png", "title": "test title", "menu":[ {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png","label":"refresh","action":"server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$"}]}
    }
{% endraw %}
.....


=== action_menu_actions
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
Defines the available server commands from action_menu_items. Key/Value pair of the name
of the script and the corresponding command. The command has to be a full path program
and *not* just a shell command. Therefor you do not have to use quotes because the arguments
are not interpreted by a shell before execution due to security reasons.

It is possible to use most standard link:macros.html[Macros] and the username is available in the `REMOTE_USER`
environment variable.

ex.:

  <action_menu_actions>
      example   = /usr/local/bin/sample.sh $HOSTNAME$ $SERVICEDESC$ $USER20$
      refresh   = /usr/local/bin/refresh.sh otherargs
  </action_menu_actions>


=== action_menu_apply
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
With apply rules adding action menus is made easy and independant from the actual
object configuration. You can setup a few regular expression rules which then add
the corresponding action menu to matching hosts and services. The syntax is
`menu_name = Hostpattern;Servicepattern`

ex.:

  <action_menu_apply>
    hostmenu    = .*;$             # matches all hosts only
    servicemenu = .*;.+$           # matches all services on all hosts
    specialmenu = ^Host;Service$   # matches an exact service on one host only
    cpu_menu    = .*;^CPU          # matches all services starting with 'CPU'
    hostmenu    = ^Host            # matches all hosts starting with 'Host'
    demomenu    = ^Demo;           # matches all services on the 'Demo' host
    demomenu    = ^Test;           # a menu name can be used multiple times
  </action_menu_apply>






== Icinga Settings

=== enable_icinga_features
This one activates all icinga specific features.
If not set, Thruk will try to auto-detect your backends.
Currently auto detection will only work within OMD. Don't enable it
unless all your backends are icinga.

ex.:

  enable_icinga_features = 1





== Shinken Settings

=== enable_shinken_features
This one activates all problem/impact and criticity features.
Currently it will only work with shinken backends. Don't enable it
unless all your backends are shinken.
If not set, it will be automatically enabled when using only
shinken backends.

ex.:

  enable_shinken_features = 1


=== priorities
Set the names of the priority (criticity in shinken). Currently this
will only work with shinken backends.

ex.:

  <priorities>
    5   = Business Critical
    4   = Top Production
    3   = Production
    2   = Standard
    1   = Testing
    0   = Development
  </priorities>





== Other Settings

=== no_external_job_forks
Normally reports will be generated in an external process to avoid
timeouts on long running reports. Use this switch to turn external
jobs off and generate reports directly. Make sure they are finished
within 40seconds which is the default fcgi timeout.

ex.:

  no_external_job_forks = 1



=== thruk_init
Path to your thruk init script. Will be used to restart thruk.

ex.:

  thruk_init = /etc/init.d/thruk


=== cookie_path

Path used for cookies. Do not change unless you have weird url
rewrites which breaks setting cookies.

ex.:

  cookie_path = /





== Component Thruk::Backend
Enter your backend connection settings here. See link:install.html#backend-configuration[Backend Configuration]
for details.

=== peer

     ** `name`          name for this connection
     ** `type`          type of this connection. Can be 'livestatus', 'http' or 'mongodb'
     ** `hidden`        should this peer be hidden initially ( can be reenabled
                        via gui switch ) Only useful with more than one
                        backend. Setting this option removes this
                        backend from any report or cli action unless
                        backends are specified explicitly.
     ** `display`       Set to 0 if you want to hide this backend from
                        the default view. This can be changed by the
                        site panel again. In opposite to the 'hidden'
                        flag, backends set to display=0 are still used
                        for automatic actions and reports.
     ** `groups`        if set, only contacts from these groups have access. You
                        may add multiple groups separated by comma. Users
                        without the right contactgroup don't even see
                        that there is a backend. Note that this implies
                        one extra backend request per page.
                        (deprecated, please do not use)
     ** `section`       to group backends/sites by different sections, enter a
                        section.
     ** `state_host`    Set 'state_host' explicitly. See See <<check_local_states,check_local_states>> for details.
     ** `options`
        *** `peer`            address of this connection.
        *** `resource_file`   resource_file for this peer (used for macro replacement)
     ** `configtool`
        *** `core_type`       Give the config parser a hint about
                              your config. Can be 'naemon', 'nagios', 'icinga'
                              or 'shinken'.
        *** `core_conf`       Path to your naemon.cfg / nagios.cfg / icinga.cfg. Read all
                              object directories and files from this config
                              file.
        *** `obj_check_cmd`   Commandline to verify the config.
        *** `obj_reload_cmd`  Commandline to reload the config.
        *** `obj_readonly`    Filename pattern to define readonly objects.
                              For example for generated config files.
                              The same effect can be achieved by
                              adding "# thruk: readonly" on top of a
                              object config file.
        *** `obj_dir`         Path to your objects. Enables the objects editor.
                              Reads all *.cfg from this folder and all subfolders.
                              (only needed when not using 'core_conf')
        *** `obj_file`        Path to a single objects file. Enables the objects
                              editor. Both 'obj_dir' and 'obj_file' can be
                              specified more than once.
                              (only needed when not using 'core_conf')
        *** `obj_exclude`     Specify some exception pattern for the obj_dir.
                              (only needed when not using 'core_conf')

        *** `git_base_dir`    Override global 'git_base_dir' value.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Backend>
    <peer>
        name   = Local Naemon
        type   = livestatus
        hidden = 1             # makes this backend hidden by default
        groups = admins,locals # makes this backend only visible to the
                               # admin and the locals contactgroup
        <options>
            peer       = /tmp/livestatus.socket
        </options>
        <configtool>
            core_conf  = /etc/naemon/naemon.cfg
            obj_check  = /etc/init.d/naemon checkconfig
            obj_reload = /etc/init.d/naemon reload
        </configtool>
    </peer>
    <peer>
        name   = External Icinga
        type   = livestatus
        <options>
            peer   = 172.16.0.2:9999
       </options>
    </peer>
    <peer>
        name   = External Shinken
        type = livestatus
        <options>
            peer   = 172.16.0.3:50000
       </options>
    </peer>
  </Component>





== Component Thruk::Plugin::ConfigTool

Enable config tool by setting path to different components config
files. Users with the roles 'authorized_for_configuration_information'
and 'authorized_for_system_commands' will then have access to the
config tool.
You don't have to restart Thruk when changing the config with the
config tool.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::ConfigTool>
    show_plugin_syntax_helper = 1
    thruk                     = .../thruk_local.conf
    cgi.cfg                   = .../cgi.cfg
    htpasswd                  = .../htpasswd

    pre_obj_save_cmd          = .../hook.sh
    post_obj_save_cmd         = .../hook.sh
    git_base_dir              = /etc/naemon/conf.d/custom/
  </Component>


=== show_plugin_syntax_helper

Enable/Disable the plugin syntax helper. When enabled, Thruk will
run the plugins with "plugin -h" to get the help information.

=== thruk
Path to your thruk_local.conf. Enables adjusting Thruks config if set.

=== cgi.cfg
Path to your cgi.cfg. Enables adjusting the cgi.cfg if set.

=== htpasswd
Path to your htpasswd. Enables user management based an Apaches basic auth with htpasswd.

=== pre_obj_save_cmd
Run a command before saving object config files. Save will be canceled
if the command returns non-zero exit code. Command will be run with
'pre' as first argument and the root config folder as second argument.
REMOTE_USER will be set in the environment.

=== post_obj_save_cmd
Run a command after saving object config files. Command will be run with
'post' as first argument and the root config folder as second
argument. REMOTE_USER will be set in the environment.

=== git_base_dir
If not all config folders are managed by git, then you can specify a
directory which is used to display the history. Should point to a
directory which is part of a git repository. This config setting is
only used for the history support in the configuration tool. The
'git_base_dir' may be overriden by an per backend value.




== Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama

The 'Panorama' plugin is a nice, fully customizable dashboard allowing
you to build your own panorama views.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
    default_dashboard    = 1,3,7,4
    readonly             = 0
    full_reload_interval = 10800
  </Component>


=== default_dashboard
Contains a comma seperated list of dashboards you want to show by default.

=== readonly
Make panorama dashboard readonly. The user cannot add, remove or
change panels and tabs. Commands may still be send according to the
user permissions.

=== dashboard_ignore_changes
Make panorama dashboard ignore changes. The user is allowed to change
some parts of the layout, but nothing is saved. Commands may still be
send according to the user permissions.

=== full_reload_interval
Full page reload every 3 hours to prevent memory
leaks. Disabled when set to 0.



== Component Thruk::Plugin::Reports2

The 'Reports2' plugin creates sla reports in html or pdf format. You
probably have to download the link:/documentation/faq.html#wkhtmltopdf[wkhtmltopdf binary] in a recent version.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Reports2>
    report_nice_level      = 5
    max_concurrent_reports = 2
    report_base_url        = http://host.local/thruk/cgi-bin/
    wkhtmltopdf            = /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf
    pnp_export             = plugins/plugins-enabled/reports2/script/pnp_export.sh
    report_from_email      = User Name <example@mail.com>
    default_template       = host_sla.tt
  </Component>

=== report_nice_level
Execute regular scheduled reports with this nice level.

=== max_concurrent_reports
{% include new_since.ad version="1.88" %}
Maximum number of reports running at a time. If more reports are started, then
they will be queued up. Default is 2.


=== report_base_url
Url used to replace relative links in html reports.

=== wkhtmltopdf
`wkhtmltopdf` is used to convert html pages into pdf.
See the link:/documentation/faq.html#wkhtmltopdf[FAQ] for download
links and further information.

=== pnp_export
pnp_export defines a script which exports a PNP4nagios graph into a
local file which then can be included in reports. PNP4nagios images
are either exported localy by executing php or remotly fetched with
wget. This works automatically in OMD, but only for local sites of
course. To make this work without OMD, set the variable 'PNP_ETC' and
'PNP_INDEX' in the ~/.thruk file of your webserver. The PNP4nagios url
is taken from the action url or from the notes url.

ex.:

  export PNP_ETC="/etc/pnp4nagios"
  export PNP_INDEX="/usr/share/pnp4nagios/htdocs/index.php"

Remote PNP4nagios graphs will be fetched by wget and usually the
graphs are password protected, so you may want to set a different wget
command to specify a username and password. This can to be set by the
'PNP_WGET' variable in the ~/.thruk file of the webserver user. You
may force to use wget by setting 'PNP_URL_PREFIX'.

ex.:

  export PNP_WGET="wget -q --user=admin --password=secret"
  export PNP_URL_PREFIX="http://demo.thruk.org"


=== report_from_email

Set the from address used in e-mail reports.
Format is "User Name <example@mail.com>"


=== default_template

Set the default template used for new reports.



== Component Thruk::Plugin::Statusmap

The Statusmap plugin gives an overview over your network.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Statusmap>
    statusmap_default_groupby = address
    statusmap_default_type    = table
  </Component>


=== statusmap_default_type
You may change the default map type of the statusmap here. Valid
types are: 'table' and 'circle'


=== statusmap_default_groupby
And the statusmap default group by which has to be one of:
'parent', 'address', 'domain', 'hostgroup', 'servicegroup'


== Component Thruk::Plugin::Minemap

The Minemap plugin gives an overview of your hosts and services.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Minemap>
    minemap_default_link = /thruk/cgi-bin/minemap.cgi
  </Component>


=== minemap_default_link
You may change the default minemap link here.



== Component Thruk::Plugin::BP

The Business Process plugin gives the possibility to create and model your business
processes. In order to edit and create new business processes you will
need the roles:

 - authorized_for_configuration_information
 - authorized_for_system_commands

Configuration Example:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::BP>
    #spool_dir             = /var/naemon/rw/check_results
    result_backend         = naemon
    objects_save_file      = /etc/naemon/conf.d/bp_generated.cfg
    objects_templates_file = /etc/naemon/conf.d/thruk_bp_templates.cfg
    objects_reload_cmd     = /etc/init.d/naemon reload
    #pre_obj_save_cmd      =
    #post_obj_save_cmd     =
    refresh_interval       = 1
  </Component>


=== spool_dir
Results will be send back by using the spool folder.
This folder should point to the 'check_result_path' of your core.

=== result_backend
As alternative to the spool_dir, a livestatus connection can be used
to send results to the core.

=== objects_save_file
Save objects to this file. Content will be overwritten.

=== objects_templates_file
User maintained file containing templates used for business process services.

=== objects_reload_cmd
Command to apply changes to the objects_save_file.

=== pre_obj_save_cmd
Run this hook command before saving a business process.

=== post_obj_save_cmd
Run this hook command after saving a business process.

=== refresh_interval
Refresh interval defines how often business processes
will be recalculated and refreshed. (in minutes)




== User & Group Specific Overrides
Both, the 'Users' and the 'Groups' directive override default settings for
single users or groups. In theory it's possible to override each and every
config setting from the thruk.conf but you will get funny results if you
override fundamental settings like backends, paths and such things.

=== Groups
The groups directive overrides specific config settings for one group only.
Group overrides are applied in alphabetical order. For example, if you have
a user in group 'Admins' and in 'Superadmins', he will get all overrides from
both groups, but the 'Admins' overrides will be superseded by the 'Superadmins'.

ex.:

...................................
    # disable all commands, except reschedule for all users
    command_disabled = 0-6,8-95,97-999

    <Group admins>
        # enable commands for admins again
        command_disabled =
    </Group>
...................................


=== Users
The users directive overrides specific config settings for one user only.

ex.:

...................................
    <User guest>
        # override single configuration item
        show_error_reports  = 0
        can_submit_commands = 0

        # also available for nested components
        <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
          default_dashboard    = 1,3,7,4
        </Component>
    </User>
...................................

== Config Files

Base configuration is managed in these configuration files (in the order in
which they are read):

-------
  * thruk.conf                     # shipped default Thruk config
  * thruk_local.d/*.{cfg,conf}     # local override drop dir
  * thruk_local.conf               # local override of Thruks settings
-------

WARNING: All configuration options described in this file should go into the
thruk_local.conf or into separate files below thruk_local.d/


=== Config file merge order

Single key/value settings are overriden in the order above. Nested key/value
pairs like Backends are merged.

ex.:

  thruk.conf:
  use_frames = 0

  thruk_local.conf:
  use_frames = 1

results in use_frames = 1

nested values:

  thruk.conf:
  <initial_menu_state>
    General        = 1
    Current_Status = 1
  </initial_menu_state>

  thruk_local.conf:
  <initial_menu_state>
    Current_Status = 0
    Bookmarks      = 1
  </initial_menu_state>

results in

  <initial_menu_state>
    General        = 1
    Current_Status = 0
    Bookmarks      = 1
  </initial_menu_state>



=== thruk.conf

The thruk.conf contains the shipped defaults. You should not edit this
file directly. Overwrite your settings in your thruk_local.conf /
thruk_local.d/ instead.

=== thruk_local.d
{% include new_since.ad version="2.00" %}
Local settings drop directory. All `\*.cfg` and `\*.conf` files in here override settings from the
thruk.conf file. Besides the standard file extension `cfg` and `conf` it is
also possible to use the hostname. Those files are only used if the hostname
matches the actual system hostname. This is a good way to separate test and
production configuration.

example:

-------
    /etc
    `-- thruk
        `-- thruk_local.d
            |-- my.cfg              # will be read on every host
            `-- test.test-machine   # will only be read on a host named `test-machine`
-------

=== thruk_local.conf

The thruk_local.conf should contain all settings which are locally overriden.
Keep the default settings in the thruk.conf and only put local overrides in
either the thruk_local.conf or into conf file below thruk_local.d/.


=== Other config files

-------
  * cgi.cfg             # Naemon/Nagios cgi.cfg
  * log4perl.conf       # Logging configuration
  * menu.conf           # Thruks default side navigation
  * menu_local.conf     # local override for the navigation
-------


=== cgi config

link:cgi-cfg.html[This cgi.cfg is described here].


=== menu config

link:menu.html[Menu customization is described here].


=== log4perl config

link:logfiles.html[Logfiles are described here].



== General Settings


=== title_prefix

set the title prefix for all urls
this piece of text will be prepended to
all page titles.

ex.:

  title_prefix = Prod


=== use_bookmark_titles

Sets the page title to the name of a bookmark
if the url matches. Private bookmarks are processed
first and the name of the first match is used.

ex.:

  use_bookmark_titles = 1


=== use_dynamic_titles

Uses more descriptive page titles.
Bookmark titles take precedence and
can be overriden by adding the title
parameter on most pages

ex.:

  use_dynamic_titles = 1


=== url_prefix

Changes the usual url path for Thruk. Don't change it unless you plan
to run multiple Thruk instances on the same webserver. You will have
to change your fastcgi configuration too.

ex.:

  url_prefix = /


=== use_timezone

*deprecated* use `server_timezone` now.

=== server_timezone
{% include new_since.ad version="2.22" %}
Changes the timezone from the systems default to this timezone.
Only set this if you have trouble with displaying the right timestamps.
Use `/usr/share/zoneinfo` on most linux systems for reference, as some
timezones are set using the Region/Country format.

ex.:

  server_timezone = CET


=== default_user_timezone
{% include new_since.ad version="2.22" %}
Since users can change their timezone setting, this changes their default.
Possible values are:

  - "Server Setting"
  - "Local Browser"
  - all from `/usr/share/zoneinfo`

ex.:

  default_user_timezone = "Server Setting"


=== cluster_nodes
{% include new_since.ad version="2.22" %}
Define generic url pattern to connect all cluster nodes. Each
cluster node must be available on the given address.
3 variables will be replaced to make this url generic:
 - $hostname$:   hostname from `hostname`
 - $url_prefix$: contains the url prefix from `url_prefix`
 - $proto$:      trying to autodetect either `http` or `https`, autodetect
                 will only work with OMD and falls back to http otherwise.

ex.:

  cluster_nodes = https://$hostname$/$url_prefix$/


=== cluster_node_stale_timeout
{% include new_since.ad version="2.22" %}
Set timeout after which a node is removed from the cluster.

ex.:

  cluster_node_stale_timeout = 120


=== mobile_agent
Specify user agents which will be redirected to the mobile plugin (if
enabled).

ex.:

  mobile_agent=iPhone,Android,IEMobile


=== default_theme

Default theme to use for all users. Must be a valid sub directory in
the themes folder.

ex.:

  default_theme = Thruk


=== first_day_of_week
Set first day of week. Used in reports.
 Sunday: 0
 Monday: 1

ex.:

  first_day_of_week = 0


=== report_use_temp_files
Large reports will use temp files to avoid extreme memory usage.
With 'report_use_temp_files' you may set the report duration in days
which will trigger the use of temp files. Default is 14days, so
for example the 'last31days' report will use temp files, the 'thisweek'
not. Can be disabled by setting to 0.

ex.:

  report_use_temp_files = 14


=== report_max_objects
Don't create reports with more hosts / services than this number.
The purpose is to don't wrack the server due to extended memory
usage. Increase this number if you hit that limit and have plenty
of memory left.

ex.:

  report_max_objects = 1000


=== report_include_class2
Include messages with class = 2 (program messages) in reports.
Setting this to 0 allows the MySQL backend to use indexes efficiently

    - 0 = off
    - 1 = auto (default)
    - 2 = on

ex.:

  report_include_class2 = 1


=== report_update_logcache
Should thruk update the logcache databases before running reports?
Setting this to 0 reduces the time taken to run reports but the most
recent data is not necessarily available.  If you use this option
you should probably create a cron to run "thruk -a logcacheupdate"

ex.:

  report_update_logcache = 1


=== start_page

This link is used as startpage and points usually to the main.html
with displays version information and general links.

ex.:

  start_page = /thruk/main.html


=== home_link

This link is used whenever you click on one of the main logos. By default
those logos are the Thruk logos and the link will take you to the Thruk homepage.
Replace this with where you want your home location to be.

ex.:

  home_link = http://www.thruk.org


=== documentation_link

This link is used in the side navigation menu as link to the documentation.
Replace with your documentation location. Set it to a blank value
if you don't want a documentation link in the menu at all.

ex.:

  documentation_link = /thruk/docs/


=== all_problems_link

Customizable link for the 'problems' link in side menu. Can be useful
to reflect your companies process of error handling.

ex.:

  all_problems_link = /thruk/cgi-bin/status.cgi?...


=== allowed_frame_links

List of allowed patterns, where links inside frames can be set to.
You can link to /thruk/frame.html?link=http://wiki.my-company.com/page/blah
Your wiki will then be displayed with the Thruk navigation frame.
Useful for other addons, so they don't have to display a own
navigation.

ex.:

  allowed_frame_links = http://intranet.my-company.com
  allowed_frame_links = https://wiki.my-company.com


=== max_process_memory

Maximum memory usage (in MB) at which a
Thruk process will exit after finishing its request.
Only affects the fcgid daemon.

ex.:

  max_process_memory=1000





== Authorization Settings


=== can_submit_commands
Set this if a contact should be allowed to send commands unless defined for the
contact itself. This is the default value for all contacts unless the user has
a can_submit_commands setting in your monitoring configuration.

ex.:

  can_submit_commands = 1


=== command_disabled
Use this to disabled specific commands. Can be use multiple times to disabled
multiple commands. The number can be found in the 'cmd_typ' cgi parameter from
links to the command page.
If you only want to allow a few commands, use `command_enabled` instead.
You may use ranges here.

ex.:

  command_disabled = 14
  command_disabled = 35
  command_disabled = 17-34,50-65


=== command_enabled
Enable only specific commands. Overrides `command_disabled` setting by only
allowing a few specific commands and disabling all others. The syntax is the
same as in `command_disabled`. If you want to disable all commands, you have to
use `command_disabled = 0-999` or set the `authorized_for_read_only` role.

ex.:

  command_enabled = 1-4         # allow adding and removing comments
  command_enabled = 33,34,51,52 # allow acknowledgments
  command_enabled = 55,56,78,79 # allow downtimes


=== make_auth_user_lowercase

Convert authenticated username to lowercase.

ex.:

  make_auth_user_lowercase = 1


=== make_auth_user_uppercase

Convert authenticated username to uppercase.

ex.:

  make_auth_user_uppercase = 1


=== make_auth_replace_regex

Convert authenticated username by regular expression. The following
example removes everything after an @ from the authenticated username
and 'user@domain' becomes just 'user'.

ex.:

  make_auth_replace_regex = s/^(.*?)@.*/$1/gmx

=== use_strict_host_authorization

When set to a true value, every contact will only see the hosts where
he is contact for plus the services where he is contact for. When
disabled, a host contact will see all services for this host
regardless of whether he is a service contact or not.

ex.:

  use_strict_host_authorization = 1


=== csrf_allowed_hosts

Allow specific hosts to bypass the csrf protection which
requires a generated token to submit certain post requests,
for example to send commands. Use comma seperated list or
multiple configuration attributes. Wildcards are allowed.

ex.:

  csrf_allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1
  csrf_allowed_hosts=192.168.*



=== disable_user_password_change

Disable the possibility for a user to change his password.
Only works with htpasswd passwords. To make this work
you have to set a `htpasswd` entry in the
link:configuration.html#component-thruk-plugin-configtool[Config Tool] section.

ex.:

  disable_user_password_change = 1



=== user_password_min_length

Sets the minimum lenght a password must have for users changing their passwords.
Admins still can change the password any way they want in the config tool. This
just affects the user password reset.

ex.:

  user_password_min_length = 5

The path to your log4perl configuration file.

ex.:

  log4perl_conf = ./log4perl.conf


=== plugin_path

Path to your plugins directory. Can be used to specify different
location for you Thruk plugins. Don't forget to set appropriate apache
alias or rewrite rules when changing the plugin path. Otherwise the
static content from plugins is not accessible.

Example redirect rule for apache:

 AliasMatch /thruk/plugins/(.*?)/(.*)$ YOUR-PLUGIN-DIR/plugins/plugins-enabled/$1/root/$2
+++++

ex.:

  plugin_path = ./plugins



=== plugin_registry_url

Url to Thruks plugin registry. The url must supply a json data structure with a
list thruk plugins. Can be specified multiple times.

ex.:

  plugin_registry_url = https://api.thruk.org/v1/plugin/list



=== themes_path

Path to your themes directory. Can be used to specify different
location for you Thruk themes. Don't forget to set appropriate apache
alias or rewrite rules when changing the themes path. Otherwise the
static content from your themes may not accessible.

+++++
 Alias /thruk/themes/ YOUR-THEMES-DIR/themes/themes-enabled/
+++++

it easy to override thruks own templates.
Template search order is:

 * users template path
 * themes template path
 * plugins template path
 * thruks template path

ex.:

  user_template_path = ./my_templates


=== logo_path_prefix

Changes the path to your logo images. Default is
$url_prefix+'thruk/themes/'+$current_theme+'/images/logos/' and
therefor relative to the current selected theme. You could set a fixed
path here.
Like usual, paths starting with a / will be absolute from your
webserver root directory. Paths starting without a / will be relative
to the cgi directory.

ex.:

  logo_path_prefix = /icons/


=== physical_logo_path

Location of your logos in your filesystem. This directory should be
mapped to your 'logo_path_prefix' directory where 'logo_path_prefix' is
the path relative to your webserver root directory and 'physical_logo_path' is
the corresponding filesystem path.

ex.:

  physical_logo_path = /usr/share/icons/


=== mode_file

Mode used when creating or saving files.

ex.:

  mode_file = 0660


=== mode_dir

Mode used when creating folders

ex.:

  mode_dir = 0770

=== resource_file
Set a general resource file.
Be warned, if any macros contain sensitive data like passwords, setting
this option could expose that data to unauthorized user. It is strongly
recommended that this option is only used if no passwords are used in
this file or in combination with the 'expand_user_macros' option which
will limit which macros are exposed to the user.
Instead of using a general 'resource_file' you could define one file
per peer in your peer config.

ex.:

  resource_file = /etc/nagios3/resource.cfg






== Search Settings

other filter is applied (except from links to hosts or groups). The filter is
negated by a leading exclamation mark. The example filters out all services starting
with "test_". You can use regular expressions. The Default is not set.

ex.:

  default_service_filter = !^test_


=== use_ajax_search

Enables the ajax search field. There will be suggestions while typing
into the search field.

ex.:

  use_ajax_search = 1

ex.:

  ajax_search_servicegroups = 1


=== ajax_search_timeperiods

Enables the suggestion of timeperiods in the ajax search field.
Timeperiods will only displayed when filtering by check- or
notification period.

ex.:

  ajax_search_timeperiods = 1





== Paging Settings


=== use_pager
Using the pager will make huge pages much faster as most people don't want a
services page with 100.000 services displayed. Can be disabled if you don't
need it.

backends and need to know which one returns an error.
Valid values are:

 1 - show site name at the end
 2 - put site name in front

ex.:

  show_backends_in_table = 0


=== show_config_edit_buttons
Show links to config tool for each host / service.
You need to have the config tool plugin enabled
and you need proper permissions for the link to appear.

ex.:

  show_config_edit_buttons = 1


=== show_full_commandline
Display the full command line for host / service checks .
Be warned, the command line could contain passwords and other confidential data.
In order to replace the user macros for commands, you have to set the
'resource_file' in your peer config or a general resource_file option.

 first: graph only the first performance value
 worst: graph only the graph for the worst state
 off: graph no value at all

ex.:

  perf_bar_mode = match


=== perf_bar_pnp_popup
Show pnp popup if performance data are available and
pnp is used as graph engine. The popup will be available
on the performance data bar chart on the right side of each
host/service. It uses the normal pnp popup logic, so you
need to install the proper SSI files.

ex.:

  perf_bar_pnp_popup = 1


=== useragentcompat
If set, a Internet Explorer (IE) compatibility header will be added to the html

extinfo page.
This works for /pnp4nagios/ urls and /pnp/.

ex.:

  shown_inline_pnp = 1


=== graph_word
graph_word is a regexp used to display any graph on the details page.
if a service or host has a graph url in action url (or notes url) set
it can be displayed by specifying a regular expression that always appears
in this url. You can specify multiple graph_words.

[TIP]
.pnp4nagios
=======
When using pnp4nagios, no graph_word is required, just keep it empty.
=======



sample service configuration for graphite:

.....
  define service{
    service_description   Load
    host_name             localhost
    use                   generic-service
    action_url            http://YOURGRAPHITE/render/?lineMode=connected&width=586&height=308&_salt=1355923874.899&target=cactiStyle($HOSTNAME$.$SERVICEDESC$.*)&xFormat=%25H%3A%25M&tz=Europe/Paris
    check_command         check_load
  }
.....

ex.:

  graph_word = /render/       # for graphite


[TIP]
.quotes
=======
Quotes are supported in the action_url statement, you may want to use it for special graphite function (http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/1.0/functions.html)
Do not escape double quotes here, otherwise graph won't work.
=======


=== graph_replace
graph_replace is another regular expression to rewrite special characters
in the url. For example graphite requires all non-word characters replaced
by underscores while graphios needs spaces removed too. You can use this
setting multiple times.

sample service configuration for graphite:

.....
graph_replace = s/[^\w\-]/_/gmx
.....

sample service configuration for graphios:

.....
graph_replace = s/\s//gmx
graph_replace = s/[^\w\-]/_/gmx
.....


=== show_custom_vars
Show custom vars in host / service ext info. List variable names to
display in the host and service extinfo details page. Can be specified
more than once to define multiple variables. You may use html in your
variables. Use * as wildcard, ex.: _VAR*
To show a host custom variable for services, prepend
_HOST, ex.:  _HOSTVAR1. To show all host variables in the service view, use
wildcards, ex.: _HOST*

ex.:

  show_custom_vars = _VAR1


=== expand_user_macros
Expand user macros ($USERx$) for host / service commands and custom
variables. Can be specified more than once to define multiple user
macros to expand.
Be warned, some user macros can contain passwords and expanding them
could expose them to unauthorized users. Use * as wildcard, ex.: USER*

Defaults to 'ALL' which means all user macros are expanded, because
its limited to admin users anyway.

ex.:

  expand_user_macros = USER1
  expand_user_macros = USER10-20
  expand_user_macros = PLUGIN*
  expand_user_macros = ALL  # expands all user macros
  expand_user_macros = NONE # do not expand user macros


=== show_error_reports
Show link to bug reports when internal errors occur.
Set to '1' to show a error icon which links to a error report mail.
Set to 'server' to log js error server side.
Set to 'both' to log server side but still show the icon.

ex.:
  show_error_reports = both


=== skip_js_errors
don't report some known harmless javascript errors

ex.:
  skip_js_errors  = cluetip is not a function


=== strict_passive_mode

Normally passive checks would be marked as disabled. With this
option set, disabled checks will only be displayed as disabled if their
last result was active. Otherwise they would be marked as passive
checks. This option also changes the passive icon only to be shown
when the last check was passive, otherwise the disabled icon will be
displayed.

ex.:

  strict_passive_mode = 1


=== hide_passive_icon
Normally passive checks whould be displayed with a passive icon
if their last result is passive.
With this option, passive icon will be hidden in status details.

ex.:
  hide_passive_icon = 0


=== sitepanel
The sitepanel is used to display multiple backends/sites at a glance.
With than 10 or more sites, the list of backends will be combined
into the 'compact' site panel which just displays the totals of
available / down / disabled sites. The 'compact' panel will also
automatically be used if you use sections.
With more than 50 backends, the 'collapsed' will be selected in 'auto' mode.
Set sitepanel to list/compact/collapsed/auto/off to change the default behaviour.

ex.:

  sitepanel = auto

=== apache_status

You can integrate the output of apache status into Thruk.
The following list of apache status pages will be accessible
from the performance info page. Make sure the page is
accessible from Thruk, credentials will be passed through. So
both, basic authentication or ip based authentication would be possible.
Read more about Apaches mod_status here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_status.html

ex.:

  <apache_status>
    Site        http://127.0.0.1:5000/server-status
    System      http://127.0.0.1/server-status
    Other       http://127.0.0.1/server-status
  </apache_status>




== Connection Settings

=== check_local_states
Get the status for remote backends from local instances. This can
increase performance when using multiple remote sites. It is enabled
by default when using more than one site. You have to define
hostchecks in any local backend (using unix sockets) with a name or
alias of the address of your remote backends. To explicitly connect
a host to a specific backend, set 'state_host' in that peer configuration.

ex.:

  check_local_states = 1


=== backend_debug
Set logging of backend in verbose mode. This only
makes sense when debug logging is activated.

ex.:

  backend_debug = 1


=== connection_pool_size
Use connection pool when accessing multiple sites.
Increases the performance because backends will be queried
parallel but uses around 10mb of memory per pool member.
Disabled when set to 0, number of concurrent connections otherwise.

ex.:

  connection_pool_size = 5


=== use_lmd_core
{% include new_since.ad version="2.12" %}
Enable lmd connection handling. Set to 1 to enable.
LMD handles all backend connections in a separate process
which will be started automatically with thruk if enabled.
Read more on lmd at: https://github.com/sni/lmd

ex.:

  use_lmd_core = 0

=== lmd_core_bin
Path to lmd binary.

ex.:

  lmd_core_bin = /usr/local/go/src/github.com/sni/lmd/lmd/lmd

=== lmd_core_config
Path to additional lmd configuration. The sites will be automatically
generated.

ex.:

  lmd_core_config = /etc/thruk/lmd.ini




=== logcache
Enables caching logfiles for faster access and less memory usage for
the naemon process. Cache supports only Mysql. Prefered
type is Mysql. Format is a Mysql connection string like
'mysql://hostname:port/db'. Using a cache dramatically decreases cpu and
memory usage of Thruk and Naemon when accessing logfiles, for example when
creating reports.

ex.:

  logcache = mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/thruk_log_cache


=== logcache_import_exclude
{% include new_since.ad version="2.10" %}
Define filter which prevents the logcache from overgrowing with useless
log messages. Since the main reason for the logcache are availability reports
it is ok to remove some entries. Can be used multiple times.

ex.:

  logcache_import_exclude = "Warning: Passive check result was received for"
  logcache_import_exclude = "wproc: "
  logcache_import_exclude = "PASSIVE SERVICE CHECK: "
  logcache_import_exclude = "PASSIVE HOST CHECK: "
  logcache_import_exclude = "Warning: Check of "
  logcache_import_exclude = "Warning: External command parse error "
  logcache_import_exclude = "EXTERNAL COMMAND: PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT"
  logcache_import_exclude = "EXTERNAL COMMAND: PROCESS_HOST_CHECK_RESULT"
  logcache_import_exclude = "External command error: Failed validation"


=== logcache_delta_updates
{% include new_since.ad version="2.12" %}
This option enables/disables the delta updates of the logcache whenever somebody
opens a page which requires logfiles, ex.: the showlog page. This improves
the responsiveness of the page but you miss the latest log entries since the
last manual update.

ex.:

  logcache_delta_updates = 1


=== logcache_import_command
The import command replaces the builtin logcache update with an external
script which is then responsible for updating the logcache database.
This might be useful if you pull the logfiles from a ndo/ido database
and then manually import those files.

There are some useful enviromenet variables set before the script is started:

  - standard macros as listed in link:cli.html#_environment-variables[CLI Environment]
  - THRUK_BACKENDS is a semicolon separated list of the selected backends.
  - THRUK_LOGCACHE is the connection string to the thruk logcache database.
  - THRUK_LOGCACHE_MODE is either 'import' on first initial import or 'update' for further consecutive updates.

ex.:

  logcache_import_command = .../importscript.sh


=== logcache_fetchlogs_command
The fetchlogs command is very similar to the `logcache_import_command` but it
replaces only the the fetching logs part from the bultin logcache.
This script should return the plain text logfiles on stdout (standard
naemon/nagios logfile format). This might be useful if you pull the logfiles
from a ndo/ido database.

See `./support/icinga2_ido_fetchlogs.sh` for an example.

There are some useful enviromenet variables set before the script is started to
control which logs should be fetched:

  - REMOTE_USER contains the current user.
  - THRUK_BACKEND  is a the id of the backends to import.
  - THRUK_LOGCACHE_START is start date to fetch
  - THRUK_LOGCACHE_END   is the end date to fetch
  - THRUK_LOGCACHE_LIMIT is the optional limit of logfiles to fetch

ex.:

  logcache_fetchlogs_command = IDO_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 IDO_DB_PORT=3306 IDO_DB_USER=root IDO_DB_PW=root IDO_DB_NAME=icinga ./support/icinga2_ido_fetchlogs.sh mysql



=== logcache_pxc_strict_mode
If you are using a mysql database with galera replication such as MariaDB Cluster,
Percona XtraDB Cluster or Galera Cluster it is a good idea to avoid locks and
optimize/repair table statements since they are not properly replicated.

Especially in Percona XtraDB Cluster > 5.6 the default setting of pxc_strict_mode
will disable locks all togheter.

This setting will make the logcache work in that case. More information about
pxc_strict_mode available here:
  - link:https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/LATEST/features/pxc-strict-mode.html[Percona documentation]

ex.:

  logcache_pxc_strict_mode = 1

=== delay_pages_after_backend_reload

Delay the page delivery until the backends uptime is at least this
amount of seconds. Displaying pages soon after backend restarts
may display wrong results and all services are pending. Enable this if
you experience problems with pending services after reloading your
backend.
Should be obsolete with Livestatus versions greater than 1.2
ex.: setting this to 10 would start serving pages 10 seconds
after the backend reload

ex.:

  delay_pages_after_backend_reload = 10


=== ssl_verify_hostnames

Can be set to enable / disable hostname verification for https connections. For
example for the cookie login or the http backend.

ex.:

  ssl_verify_hostnames = 1


=== use_shadow_naemon

*shadownaemon is deprecated, use lmd instead*

Enable usage of shadownaemon. This is a daemon which shadows a remote
core via livestatus and therefor removes network latency from accessing
remote sites. It also reduces network bandwidth usage. Best used together
with the logcache. Enabled with any true value, disabled when set to '0'.
Usually the shadownaemon processes are stopped when the last thruk
process exists, this can be changed by setting this option to 'start_only'.

Default: 0

ex.:

    use_shadow_naemon=1


=== shadow_naemon_dir
Defines the folder where all shadow cores will run in. This
also defines the path to the local socket, which will be
'shadow_naemon_dir'/'peer key'/live

ex.:

    shadow_naemon_dir=/omd/sites/<site>/tmp/remotecache


=== shadow_naemon_bin
Defines the path to the shadownaemon binary.

ex.:

    shadow_naemon_bin=/omd/sites/<site>/bin/shadownaemon


== Cookie Authentication Settings

=== cookie_auth_login_url
Specifies the url where non-authenticated users will be redirected
too.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_login_url = thruk/cgi-bin/login.cgi


=== cookie_auth_restricted_url
Specifies the url against the cookie auth provider will verify its
credentials.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_restricted_url = http://localhost/thruk/cgi-bin/restricted.cgi


=== cookie_auth_session_timeout
Specifies the timeout for idle sessions.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_session_timeout       = 86400


=== cookie_auth_session_cache_timeout
Specifies the amount of seconds in which subsequent requests won't
verify authentication again. Set to zero to disable storing hashed
credentials in the filesystem and disabling revalidation of active
sessions.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_session_cache_timeout = 30


=== cookie_auth_login_timeout
Timeout for internal sub request on authentication url. Defaults to 10 seconds
and can be disabled by setting it to zero.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_login_timeout = 10


=== cookie_auth_domain

Cookie domain is usually set automatically. Use this option
to override the default value. Domains have to contain at least
two periods. Useful for single sign on environments.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_domain = .domain.com


=== cookie_auth_login_hook

Hook script which is called on every successful login. The REMOTE_USER
environment variable will be set to the username of the current logged
in user. Useful to do magic stuff on each login. The REMOTE_USER_GROUPS
environment variable contains semicolon separated list of contactgroups.
Available standard environment variables are listed on the
link:cli.html#_environment-variables[CLI Environment] page.

ex.:

  cookie_auth_login_hook = ./bin/hook.sh


=== cookie_auth_direct_agents
{% include new_since.ad version="2.10" %}
This is a regular expression to set user agents which are allowed to request
pages with normal basic auth.
Use it to allow scripts easy access with bypassing the cookie auth and directly
accessing pages.
See an example in the link:cli.html#_curl-wget[cli section].

Default: (curl|wget)

ex.:

  cookie_auth_direct_agents = (wget|curl|python|Go-http-client)




== Command Settings

=== cmd_defaults
Set the default checked state for command options.

ex.:

  <cmd_defaults>
    ahas                   = 0  # For Hosts Too
    broadcast_notification = 0  # Broadcast
    force_check            = 0  # Forced Check
    force_notification     = 0  # Forced Notification
    send_notification      = 1  # Send Notification
    sticky_ack             = 1  # Sticky Acknowledgement
    persistent_comments    = 1  # Persistent Comments
    persistent_ack         = 0  # Persistent Acknowledgement Comments
    ptc                    = 0  # For Child Hosts Too
    use_expire             = 0  # Use expire time ( for cores which support it)
  </cmd_defaults>


=== force_sticky_ack
Forces acknowledgments to be sticky.

ex.:

  force_sticky_ack = 1


=== force_send_notification
Forces sending a notification for acknowledgments.

ex.:

  force_send_notification = 1


=== force_persistent_ack
Forces comments on acknowledgments to be persistent.

ex.:

  force_persistent_ack = 1


=== force_persistent_comments
Forces normal comments to be persistent.

ex.:

  force_persistent_comments = 1


=== downtime_duration
Default duration of new downtimes in seconds. Default is 2 hours.

ex.:

  downtime_duration = 7200


=== downtime_max_duration
Maximum duration of new downtimes. Use quantifiers like d=days, w=weeks,
y=years to set human readable values. Default is unlimited.

ex.:

  downtime_max_duration = 4w


=== expire_ack_duration
Default duration of acknowledgements with expire date. Default is one
day.

ex.:

  expire_ack_duration = 86400



=== cmd_quick_status
Configure which commands should be available as quick status commands.

ex.:

  <cmd_quick_status>
    reschedule             = 0  # Reschedule next check
    downtime               = 0  # Add/remove downtimes
    comment                = 0  # Add/remove comments
    acknowledgement        = 0  # Add/remove acknowledgements
    active_checks          = 0  # Enable/disable active checks
    notifications          = 0  # Enable/disable notifications
    submit_result          = 0  # Submit passive check result
    reset_attributes       = 0  # Reset modified attributes
  </cmd_quick_status>



=== command_reschedule_alias
When you want to reschedule passive checks for which the result is fetched by
an agent (For example check_mk or some scenarios of check_multi). You
usually want to reschedule the agent instead of the passive check.

The command reschedule alias can be used to translate the reschedule command
from the passive service to the active agent service.

  command_reschedule_alias = pattern;master_service_description

.Notes
* The pattern will be tested against the service description and the command_name
  of the passive check.
* The resulting service name be on the same host and the contact must
  be authorized for that service too.
* The pattern must be a valid perl regular expression.
* Duplicates  will be removed. So if you reschedule 10 services which result in
  the same master service will only trigger one reschedule.
* Only passive services will be translated

In this example, all passive check_mk checks will trigger the active agent check
and therefor allow you to reschedule passive checks directly from the problems
page.

ex.:

  command_reschedule_alias = ^check_mk\-(?!inventory);Check_MK


=== use_feature_recurring_downtime
Use recurring downtime, shows recurring downtime links.

ex.:

  use_feature_recurring_downtime = 1


=== use_service_description
Use service's description instead of display name.

ex.:

  use_service_description = 1


=== use_feature_trends
Use trends, shows trend links.

ex.:

  use_feature_trends = 1


=== use_wait_feature
Waiting is a livestatus feature. When enabled, Thruk will wait
after rescheduling hosts/services checks until the
check has been really executed up to a maximum of 10 seconds. Adjust
the time waiting with the 'wait_timeout' option.

ex.:

  use_wait_feature = 1


=== wait_timeout
Amount of seconds to wait until a rescheduled check finishes. Thruk
will wait this amount and display the result immediately.

ex.:

  wait_timeout = 10


=== require_comments_for_disable_cmds
If set to 1, the user has to enter a comment for all disable active checks /
disable notifications / disable event handler commands. These comments are
automatically prefixed with the command name and will be deleted when checks /
notifications / handlers are enabled again. They are also used by the
'reenable_actions' utility.

ex.:

  require_comments_for_disable_cmds = 1





== Cron Settings


=== cron_file
Specify a file which is then completely under the control of Thruk.
It will be used to store cronjobs, ex. for reports. The file has to be
writable by Thruk.

ex.:

  cron_file = /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


=== cron_pre_edit_cmd
The pre edit cmd can be used to do run a command just before Thruk
will edit the crontab.

ex.:

  cron_pre_edit_cmd  = /usr/bin/crontab -l > /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


=== cron_post_edit_cmd
The post edit cmd is necessary for OMD where you need to reload the
crontab after editing or for replacing the users cron with the edited
file.

ex.:

  cron_post_edit_cmd = crontab /tmp/thruk_cron.tmp


=== thruk_bin
Path to your thruk executable. Will be used in cronjobs.

ex.:

  thruk_bin = /usr/bin/thruk



== Action Menu Settings
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
The Action Menu is a way to create custom icons and menus for every host or service. There
are two ways to set the menu. First one is to directly assign the menu json data
into the _THRUK_ACTION_MENU custom variable of your host or service. Or you can
just put a placeholder into the _THRUK_ACTION_MENU custom variable and define the
actual menu in 'action_menu_items'. You may add multiple action icons or even
multiple menus for each host or service.

image:source/action_menu.png[Custom Action Menu]

See the link:action-menu.html[Action Menu] section from the advanced topics for
more examples and details.

=== action_menu_items
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
Defines the menu used by placeholders from the '_THRUK_ACTION_MENU' custom variable.
The menu is a key/value pair with the name and the menu description in json format.
The menu can either be a single icon/menu or a list of menus and icons.

A simple menu could look like this, note that the menu has to be in a single line
without newlines and all newlines from the example have to be removed in order
to try that. But its more readable this way. You can also use a trailing
backslash to write the menus on multiple lines.

Sample menu with two items and a seperator:

.....
{% raw %}
  {
    "icon":"../themes/{{theme}}/images/dropdown.png",
    "title": "sample menu",
    "menu": [
      {
        "icon":   "../themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png",
        "label":  "refresh",
        "action": "server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$"
      },
      {
        "icon":   "../themes/{{theme}}/images/page_white_key.png",
        "label":  "example",
        "action": "server://example/$HOSTNAME$/$SERVICEDESC$"
      },
      "-",
      {
        "icon":   "../themes/{{theme}}/images/page_white_text.png",
        "label":  "wiki",
        "action": "http://company-wiki/pages/$HOSTNAME$"
      }
    ]
  }
{% endraw %}
.....

A menu has the following attributes:

     ** `icon`          icon for the menu itself. You can use `{% raw %}{{theme}}{% endraw %}` as placeholder in the url
                        and `{% raw %}{{remote_user}}{% endraw %}` for the user name. Within OMD, the the site variable `{% raw %}{{site}}{% endraw %}` must be prepended.
     ** `title`         title of the menu, will be display on mouse over.
     ** `menu`          the actual menu definition as a list '[...]' of sub items.
     ** `...`           arbitrary attributes will be used as attributes of the menu icon html element.

A single `"-"` item can be used as a menu item seperator.


The menu item can have the following attributes:

     ** `icon`          icon for the menu item. You can use `{% raw %}{{theme}}{% endraw %}` as placeholder in the url. Within OMD, the the site variable `{% raw %}{{site}}{% endraw %}` must be prepended.
     ** `label`         label name of the menu item.
     ** `action`        url or action which will be run or openend. This can either be a
                        http(s) link or a serveraction in the form server://actionname/argument1/argument2/...
                        the actionname must be a reference to a command from 'action_menu_actions'.
                        You may use `{% raw %}{{macros}}{% endraw %}` here too. Also javascript: links are valid,
                        for example `javascript:alert('$HOSTNAME$')`.
     ** `target`        Use '_blank' here to open link in a new window.
     ** `onclick`       confirmation dialog or any other callback, ex: "return(confirm('Really restart service?'));"
     ** `close_timeout` timeout till the result popup will close, defaults to 5 seconds if ok or 30 seconds if failed. Set to zero to never close the result popup.
     ** `...`           arbitrary attributes will be used as attributes of the menu item link html element.


==== action menu macros

The following macros can be used in the icon url and the link url:

     ** `{% raw %}{{theme}}{% endraw %}`        contains the current selected user theme
     ** `{% raw %}{{remote_user}}{% endraw %}`  contains the user name itself. (Do not rely on this value, a user can change the url by himself)
     ** `{% raw %}{{prefix}}{% endraw %}`       the url path prefix, ex.: /thruk
     ** `{% raw %}{{site}}{% endraw %}`         the OMD site name.


Sample icons with two action icons:

.....
{% raw %}
  [
    {
      "icon":"../themes/{{theme}}/images/criticity_1.png",
      "action":"http://splunk/abc/hostid=$_HOSTHOSTID$",
      "target":"_blank"
    },
    {
      "icon":"../themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png",
      "action":"server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$",
    }
  ]
{% endraw %}
.....


*Variant 1* - put your action menus into a separate folder.
{% include new_since.ad version="2.10" %}

.....
{% raw %}
  *thruk_local.conf:*

    action_menu_items_folder /etc/thruk/action_menus/

{% endraw %}
.....

Menu files must have the .json file extension and contain the raw json
definition of the action menu. One menu per file. The menu can be referenced
by the filename later. For example if you filename is `/etc/thruk/action_menus/somemenu.json` then
you can access the menu by the name `somemenu`.


*Variant 2* - reference a menu from an external file:
{% include new_since.ad version="2.10" %}

.....
{% raw %}
  *thruk_local.conf:*

    <action_menu_items>
        standardmenu      = file:///etc/thruk/standardmenu.json
    </action_menu_items>
{% endraw %}
.....

Menu files must contain the raw json definition of the action menu.


*Variant 3* - reference to a pre defined menu:

.....
{% raw %}
  *thruk_local.conf:*

    <action_menu_items>
        standardmenu = {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/dropdown.png",\
                        "title": "test title",\
                        "menu":[\
                           {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png",\
                            "label":"refresh",\
                            "action":"server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$"}\
                        ]\
                       }
    </action_menu_items>

  *host.cfg:*

    define host {
      host_name            localhost
      ...
      _THRUK_ACTION_MENU   standardmenu
    }
{% endraw %}
.....


*Variant 4* - define the menu in object config only:

This obviously adds some overhead to your objects, so better use the other variants
unless you want to change the menu from external commands.

.....
{% raw %}
  *host.cfg:*

    define host {
      host_name            localhost
      ...
      _THRUK_ACTION_MENU   {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/dropdown.png", "title": "test title", "menu":[ {"icon":"/thruk/themes/{{theme}}/images/arrow_refresh.png","label":"refresh","action":"server://refresh/$HOSTNAME$"}]}
    }
{% endraw %}
.....


=== action_menu_items_folder
{% include new_since.ad version="2.10" %}
Organize action_menu_items in a folder. Each file in this folder will be read as
action menu.

Both examples are equivalent and result in the same menu assuming there is
a `/etc/thruk/action_menus/hostmenu.json` file.

.....
{% raw %}
    action_menu_items_folder    =  /etc/thruk/action_menus/
{% endraw %}
.....

.....
{% raw %}
    <action_menu_items>
        hostmenu      = file:///etc/thruk/action_menus/hostmenu.json
    </action_menu_items>
{% endraw %}
.....

=== action_menu_apply
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
With apply rules adding action menus is made easy and independant from the actual
object configuration. You can setup a few regular expression rules which then add
the corresponding action menu to matching hosts and services. The syntax is
`menu_name = Hostpattern;Servicepattern`

ex.:

  <action_menu_apply>
    hostmenu    = .*;$             # matches all hosts only
    servicemenu = .*;.+$           # matches all services on all hosts
    specialmenu = ^Host;Service$   # matches an exact service on one host only
    cpu_menu    = .*;CPU           # matches all services starting with 'CPU'
    hostmenu    = ^Host            # matches all hosts starting with 'Host' (incl. services)
    demomenu    = ^Demo;.*$        # matches all services on the 'Demo' host
    demomenu    = ^Test;           # a menu name can be used multiple times
  </action_menu_apply>



=== action_menu_actions
{% include new_since.ad version="1.86" %}
Defines the available server commands from action_menu_items. Key/Value pair of the name
of the script and the corresponding command. The command has to be a full path program
and *not* just a shell command. Therefor you do not have to use quotes because the arguments
are not interpreted by a shell before execution due to security reasons.

It is possible to use most standard link:macros.html[Macros] and the username is available in the `REMOTE_USER`
environment variable.

ex.:

  <action_menu_actions>
      example   = /usr/local/bin/sample.sh $HOSTNAME$ $SERVICEDESC$ $USER20$
      refresh   = /usr/local/bin/refresh.sh otherargs
  </action_menu_actions>





== Icinga Settings

=== enable_icinga_features
This one activates all icinga specific features.
If not set, Thruk will try to auto-detect your backends.
Currently auto detection will only work within OMD. Don't enable it
unless all your backends are icinga.

ex.:

  enable_icinga_features = 1





== Shinken Settings

=== enable_shinken_features
This one activates all problem/impact and criticity features.
Currently it will only work with shinken backends. Don't enable it
unless all your backends are shinken.
If not set, it will be automatically enabled when using only
shinken backends.

ex.:

  enable_shinken_features = 1


=== priorities
Set the names of the priority (criticity in shinken). Currently this
will only work with shinken backends.

ex.:

  <priorities>
    5   = Business Critical
    4   = Top Production
    3   = Production
    2   = Standard
    1   = Testing
    0   = Development
  </priorities>





== Other Settings

=== no_external_job_forks
Normally reports will be generated in an external process to avoid
timeouts on long running reports. Use this switch to turn external
jobs off and generate reports directly. Make sure they are finished
within 40seconds which is the default fcgi timeout.

ex.:

  no_external_job_forks = 1



=== thruk_init
Path to your thruk init script. Will be used to restart thruk.

ex.:

  thruk_init = /etc/init.d/thruk


=== cookie_path

Path used for cookies. Do not change unless you have weird url
rewrites which breaks setting cookies.

ex.:

  cookie_path = /





== Component Thruk::Backend
Enter your backend connection settings here. See link:install.html#backend-configuration[Backend Configuration]
for details.

=== peer

     ** `name`          name for this connection
     ** `type`          type of this connection. Can be 'livestatus' or 'http'.
     ** `hidden`        should this peer be hidden initially ( can be reenabled
                        via gui switch ) Only useful with more than one
                        backend. Setting this option removes this
                        backend from any report or cli action unless
                        backends are specified explicitly.
     ** `display`       Set to 0 if you want to hide this backend from
                        the default view. This can be changed by the
                        site panel again. In opposite to the 'hidden'
                        flag, backends set to display=0 are still used
                        for automatic actions and reports.
     ** `groups`        if set, only contacts from these groups have access. You
                        may add multiple groups separated by comma. Users
                        without the right contactgroup don't even see
                        that there is a backend. Note that this implies
                        one extra backend request per page.
                        (deprecated, please do not use)
     ** `section`       to group backends/sites by different sections, enter a
                        section.
     ** `state_host`    Set 'state_host' explicitly. See See <<check_local_states,check_local_states>> for details.
     ** `options`
        *** `peer`            address of this connection.
        *** `resource_file`   resource_file for this peer (used for macro replacement)
        *** `auth`            secret key for http connections.
        *** `remote_name`     remote site name for http connections (required if remote instance is connected to multiple backends)
        *** `fallback_peer`   fallback connection address
        *** `cert`            optional client certificate for tls connections
        *** `key`             optional client key for tls connections
        *** `ca_file`         ca file to verify tls server
        *** `verify`          set to 0 to disable any tls verification
     ** `configtool`
        *** `core_type`       Give the config parser a hint about
                              your config. Can be 'naemon', 'nagios', 'icinga'
                              or 'shinken'.
        *** `core_conf`       Path to your naemon.cfg / nagios.cfg / icinga.cfg. Read all
                              object directories and files from this config
                              file.
        *** `obj_check_cmd`   Commandline to verify the config.
                              Use something like 'sudo -u root /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg'
                              if you have different user for Thruk and the monitoring core.
                              See http://monitoring-portal.org/wbb/index.php?page=Thread&postID=224902#post224902 for an example.
        *** `obj_reload_cmd`  Commandline to reload the config.
        *** `obj_readonly`    Filename pattern to define readonly objects.
                              For example for generated config files.
                              The same effect can be achieved by
                              adding "# thruk: readonly" on top of a
                              object config file.
        *** `obj_dir`         Path to your objects. Enables the objects editor.
                              Reads all *.cfg from this folder and all subfolders.
                              (only needed when not using 'core_conf')
        *** `obj_file`        Path to a single objects file. Enables the objects
                              editor. Both 'obj_dir' and 'obj_file' can be
                              specified more than once.
                              (only needed when not using 'core_conf')
        *** `obj_exclude`     Specify some exception pattern for the obj_dir.
                              (only needed when not using 'core_conf')

        *** `git_base_dir`    Override global 'git_base_dir' value.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Backend>
    <peer>
        name   = Local Naemon
        type   = livestatus
        hidden = 1             # makes this backend hidden by default

== Component Thruk::Plugin::ConfigTool

Enable config tool by setting path to different components config
files. Users with the roles 'authorized_for_configuration_information'
and 'authorized_for_system_commands' will then have access to the
config tool.
You don't have to restart Thruk when changing the config with the
config tool.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::ConfigTool>
    show_plugin_syntax_helper = 1
    thruk                     = .../thruk_local.conf
    cgi.cfg                   = .../cgi.cfg
    htpasswd                  = .../htpasswd
    pre_obj_save_cmd          = .../hook.sh
    post_obj_save_cmd         = .../hook.sh
    git_base_dir              = /etc/naemon/conf.d/custom/
    show_summary_prompt       = 1
    #edit_files               = some/extra/files/to.edit # deprecated
    extra_custom_var_host     = _WORKER
    extra_custom_var_service  = _SNMP_COMMUNITY, _OTHER_CUSTOM_VARIABLE
  </Component>


=== show_plugin_syntax_helper

=== git_base_dir
If not all config folders are managed by git, then you can specify a
directory which is used to display the history. Should point to a
directory which is part of a git repository. This config setting is
only used for the history support in the configuration tool. The
'git_base_dir' may be overriden by an per backend value.

=== show_summary_prompt
Thruk will show a prompt to input a change summary if a 'post_obj_save_cmd' is
set. You can use this option to suppress that prompt.


=== edit_files

**DEPRECATED:** please use the editor plugin now.

Specify some extra files which can then be edited by the Thruk configtool
text editor. Can be used multiple times. When used with a directory, all
files below can be edited.

== Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama

The 'Panorama' plugin is a nice, fully customizable dashboard allowing
you to build your own panorama views.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
    default_dashboard      = 1,3,7,4
    readonly               = 0
    full_reload_interval   = 10800
    geo_map_default_center = 13.74,47.77
    geo_map_default_zoom   = 5
    extra_fonts            = CompanyFont1, CompanyFont2
    new_files_start_at     = 1
    default_state_order    = down, unreachable, ...
  </Component>


=== default_dashboard
Contains a comma seperated list of dashboards you want to show by default.

=== readonly
Make panorama dashboard readonly. The user cannot add, remove or
change panels and tabs. Commands may still be send according to the
user permissions.

=== dashboard_ignore_changes
Make panorama dashboard ignore changes. The user is allowed to change
some parts of the layout, but nothing is saved. Commands may still be
send according to the user permissions.

=== full_reload_interval
Full page reload every 3 hours to prevent memory
leaks. Disabled when set to 0.

=== new_files_start_at
Normally new files start at index 1 but this can be changed here. This helps in
situations when more than one Thruk installation has to create dashboards in
the same folder.

=== default_state_order
Defines the order to determine the worst state for filter and group icons.

=== geo_map_default_center
Default coordinates (lon,lat) for new geo maps.

=== geo_map_default_zoom

 ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
    ...
    wms_provider = <providername>   = ["<wms-ur>l", {"layers": "<layername>"}"]
  </Component>

=== extra_fonts
Comma separated list of additional fonts which will be listed in the text label
drop down selection.



== Component Thruk::Plugin::Reports2

The 'Reports2' plugin creates sla reports in html or pdf format. You
probably have to download the link:/documentation/faq.html#phantomjs[phantomjs binary] in a recent version.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Reports2>
    report_nice_level      = 5
    max_concurrent_reports = 2
    report_base_url        = http://host.local/thruk/cgi-bin/
    phantomjs              = /usr/bin/phantomjs
    pnp_export             = script/pnp_export.sh
    grafana_export         = script/grafana_export.sh
    report_from_email      = User Name <example@mail.com>
    default_template       = host_sla.tt
  </Component>

=== report_nice_level
Execute regular scheduled reports with this nice level.

=== max_concurrent_reports
{% include new_since.ad version="1.88" %}
Maximum number of reports running at a time. If more reports are started, then
they will be queued up. Default is 2.


=== report_base_url
Url used to replace relative links in html reports.

=== phantomjs
`phantomjs` is used to convert html pages into pdf.
See the link:/documentation/faq.html#phantomjs[FAQ] for download
links and further information.

=== pnp_export
pnp_export defines a script which exports a PNP4nagios graph into a
local file which then can be included in reports. PNP4nagios images
are either exported localy by executing php or remotly fetched with
wget. This works automatically in OMD, but only for local sites of
course. To make this work without OMD, set the variable 'PNP_ETC' and
'PNP_INDEX' in the ~/.thruk file of your webserver. The PNP4nagios url
is taken from the action url or from the notes url.

ex.:

  export PNP_ETC="/etc/pnp4nagios"
  export PNP_INDEX="/usr/share/pnp4nagios/htdocs/index.php"

Remote PNP4nagios graphs will be fetched by wget and usually the
graphs are password protected, so you may want to set a different wget
command to specify a username and password. This can to be set by the
'PNP_WGET' variable in the ~/.thruk file of the webserver user. You
may force to use wget by setting 'PNP_URL_PREFIX'.

ex.:

  export PNP_WGET="wget -q --user=admin --password=secret"
  export PNP_URL_PREFIX="http://demo.thruk.org"


=== grafana_export

Override default script for exporting grafana graphs to png with `grafana_export`.


=== report_from_email

Set the from address used in e-mail reports.
Format is "User Name <example@mail.com>"


=== default_template

Set the default template used for new reports.



== Component Thruk::Plugin::Statusmap

The Statusmap plugin gives an overview over your network.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Statusmap>
    statusmap_default_groupby = address
    statusmap_default_type    = table
  </Component>


=== statusmap_default_type
You may change the default map type of the statusmap here. Valid
types are: 'table' and 'circle'


=== statusmap_default_groupby
And the statusmap default group by which has to be one of:
'parent', 'address', 'domain', 'hostgroup', 'servicegroup'


== Component Thruk::Plugin::Minemap

The Minemap plugin gives an overview of your hosts and services.

ex.:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Minemap>
    minemap_default_link = /thruk/cgi-bin/minemap.cgi
  </Component>


=== minemap_default_link
You may change the default minemap link here.



== Component Thruk::Plugin::BP

The Business Process plugin gives the possibility to create and model your business
processes. In order to edit and create new business processes you will
need the roles:

 - authorized_for_configuration_information
 - authorized_for_system_commands

Configuration Example:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::BP>
    #spool_dir             = /var/naemon/rw/check_results
    result_backend         = naemon
    objects_save_file      = /etc/naemon/conf.d/bp_generated.cfg
    objects_templates_file = /etc/naemon/conf.d/thruk_bp_templates.cfg
    objects_reload_cmd     = /etc/init.d/naemon reload
    #pre_save_cmd          =
    #post_save_cmd         =
    refresh_interval       = 1
    #favorite_custom_function = echo ; echo_function
    #worker                = 5
  </Component>


=== spool_dir
Results will be send back by using the spool folder.
This folder should point to the 'check_result_path' of your core.

=== result_backend
As alternative to the spool_dir, a livestatus connection can be used
to send results to the core. Set the name or key of the backend with
this option.

=== objects_save_file
Save objects to this file. Content will be overwritten.

=== objects_save_format
File format of the saved objects. Valid formats are 'nagios' and 'icinga2'.

=== objects_templates_file
User maintained file containing templates used for business process services.

=== objects_reload_cmd
Command to apply changes to the objects_save_file.

=== pre_save_cmd
Run this hook command before saving a business process.
Along with the default environment variables set, there are two extra variables set which can be used:

  - THRUK_BP_FILE:  contains the file name of the business process being saved
  - THRUK_BP_STAGE: is set to 'pre'

=== post_save_cmd
Run this hook command after saving a business process.
The same environment variables will be used as in the pre_save_cmd, except
stage is set to 'post'.

=== refresh_interval
Refresh interval defines how often business processes
will be recalculated and refreshed. (in minutes)


=== favorite_custom_function
Favorite custom function will be displayed on the 'Type' tab
so you don't have to select custom first. Syntax is <name>;<function>


=== worker
Set the number of parallel business process calculations. Setting it
to 1 disables parallelization. Setting it to 0 trys to autodetect a
suitable value.

== Component Thruk::Plugin::Mobile

The Mobile plugin adds a mobile view component.

Configuration Example:

  <Component Thruk::Plugin::Mobile>
    links   = Dashboard ABC ; panorama.cgi?map=ABC
    links   = My Problems   ; \#problems?contact=$CONTACTNAME$
  </Component>


=== links
{% include new_since.ad version="2.18" %}
Additonal links on the start page in the form `<name> ; <url>`.
The url is relative to the mobile.cgi



== User & Group Specific Overrides
Both, the 'Users' and the 'Groups' directive override default settings for
single users or groups. In theory it's possible to override each and every
config setting from the thruk.conf but you will get funny results if you
override fundamental settings like backends, paths and such things.

'Groups' are contact groups from your monitoring core and 'Users' are the
contact names as they show up in the Thruk interface.

=== Groups
The groups directive overrides specific config settings for one group only.
Group overrides are applied in alphabetical order. For example, if you have
a user in group 'Admins' and in 'Superadmins', he will get all overrides from
both groups, but the 'Admins' overrides will be superseded by the 'Superadmins'.

ex.:

...................................
    # disable all commands, except reschedule for all users
    command_disabled = 0-6,8-95,97-999

    <Group admins>
        # enable commands for admins again
        command_disabled =
    </Group>
...................................


=== Users
The users directive overrides specific config settings for one user only.

ex.:

...................................
    <User guest>
        # override single configuration item
        show_error_reports  = 0
        can_submit_commands = 0

        # also available for nested components
        <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
          default_dashboard    = 1,3,7,4
        </Component>
    </User>
...................................

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

== General

=== What is Thruk?
Thruk is a Webgui for Nagios (and compatible) based on the Livestatus
API. It's capable of merging multiple cores into a single display
while being much faster than the original cgis. In addition there have
been tons of usability improvments and there are plenty of useful
addons included like a dashboard, business process addons, a
configuration interface and many more...


=== Is Thruk an Abbreviation? What does Thruk mean?

Thruk is just a random word and has no meaning. Pronounce it like 'Truck'.


=== Where is the statusmap?

The statusmap got replaced by a own variant which is more scalable in
large environments. Its shipped as Thruk addon, but enabled by
default. See the link:plugins.html[plugins page] for details and screenshots.


=== Authorization/Authentication is not working

Authentication is done by the webserver, so authentication is only available
with the fastcgi version.


=== All dates and times are displayed with the wrong timezone

Try to set the use_timezone configuration option in your
thruk_local.conf



== Usage

=== How do I select hosts/services on the status page?

Just click on the empty table row when the row is highlighted. This only works
if you do not click on a link.


=== How can i enable debug logging

Have a look at the link:logfiles.html#enable-debug-logging[logfiles section].


=== Where can I see the full command line for a host or servicecheck?

You have to enable the option 'set show_full_commandline'. It's
disabled for security reasons by default. So be careful to not display
any passwords though the webinterface.




== Customization

=== Enable HTTPS / TLS / SSL in Apache Webserver for Thruk
Thruk works just fine with https, you just need to make sure that the include file
has been added to the ssl vhost as well (rewrite rules are not inherited into vhosts).

Example on Centos 7:

Install `mod_ssl` package to enable ssl in the Apache.

  #> yum install mod_ssl

Edit the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` and search for `<VirtualHost _default_:443>`
and add the include somewhere in the `VirtualHost` tag. For example at the end
of the file.

---
  <VirtualHost _default_:443>
    ...
    Include /usr/share/thruk/thruk_cookie_auth.include
  </VirtualHost>

---

You may also wish to modify your `/etc/thruk/thruk_local.conf` to use an updated `cookie_auth_restricted_url`:
---
  cookie_auth_restricted_url = https://localhost/thruk/cgi-bin/restricted.cgi
  
---

Finally reload Apache:

  #> systemctl reload httpd

=== How to change the side menu
This is covered in the link:menu.html[advanced menu] section.

=== How can I integrate Nagvis Maps

There is an example in the link:menu.html#nagvis-maps[menu] documentation.

=== How can I integrate Nagvis Maps in the Panorama Dashboard

Choose 'Generic Url Panlet' from the 'New Panlet' list. Then enter
the following url:
....
/nagvis/frontend/nagvis-js/index.php?mod=Map&act=view&show=demo-automap
....
Replace demo-automap with the name of your map. If you use OMD, you have
to prepend the site name to the url.

[TIP]
.nagvis panel
=======
There is a dedicated nagvis panel since Thruk release 1.78.
=======


=== How can I add more themes?

Themes are located under 'themes'. Just copy and modify the one you
like. See the link:themes.html[themes page] for details.


=== How can I disable themes?

Themes can be disabled by removing the symlink from your
'themes/themes-enabled' directory.
See the link:themes.html[themes page] for details.


=== How can I customize reports?
Customizing reports is coverd in the link:reporting.html#customized-reports[official documenation].

=== Why are the PNP graphs missing in my reports?
First you need a working PNP installation. Then check
the link:configuration.html#pnp_export[official documenation].

If nothing helps, add some debug output to the script which is responsible for
the pnp export (experienced users only).

Add these lines to 'plugins/plugins-available/reports2/script/pnp_export.sh'.

-------
exec >/tmp/pnp.log 2>&1
set -x
-------

Then regenerate a report and investigate that new logfile.


=== How can I create a readonly Panorama dashboard for my boss
In combination with the user specific settings, this can easily be achieved in
your thruk_local.conf:

-------
  <User boss>
    <Component Thruk::Plugin::Panorama>
      default_view    = /var/lib/thruk/panorama_view.boss
      readonly        = 1
  </Component>
  </User>
-------

The default view can be exported from the 'Settings' menu inside the panorama
dashboard.



=== How can I set custom page titles
There are few ways to do this. The first way is you can turn on the
use_bookmark_titles in your thruk_local.conf:

-------
    use_bookmark_titles = 1
-------

Now anytime you go to one of your Thruk bookmarks the name of
that bookmark will be used as the page title.
The second option is on most pages adding 'title=your title here' to
the url will set a custom title


=== How can I enable form based authentication
{% include note.ad text="activated by default since v2.0" %}
In order to use the form or cookie based authentication like demo.thruk.org does,
you have to do two small changes in your apache configuration.
Get https://github.com/sni/Thruk/blob/master/support/thruk_cookie_auth.example[thruk_cookie_auth.example]
and put everything except the RewriteLock into the virtualhost of your choice.
The RewriteLock must be outside any virtualhost. After that, restart the apache.


=== How can I disable cookie authentication

TIP: In OMD you just need to run `omd config set THRUK_COOKIE_AUTH off`

Starting with v2.0 cookie (form based) authentication is enabled by default. In
case you want to disable it again and switch back to standard basic
authentication, you just need to comment the includes in your apache
configuration.

On Debian and Ubuntu open all files matching:

    /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*default*
    /etc/apache2/conf-available/thruk_cookie_auth_vhost.conf

On SLES systems open:

    /etc/apache2/conf.d/thruk_cookie_auth_vhost.conf

On Centos/RHEL systems open:

    /etc/httpd/conf.d/thruk_cookie_auth_vhost.conf

then comment the line with:

    Include /usr/share/thruk/thruk_cookie_auth.include

After that, restart the apache.

== Installation

=== Is it possible to operate Thruk in a cluster?
Yes, just put a load balancer before 2 (or more) Thruk installations
and make sure the 'var_path' directory is shared between all instances ( by
NFS, DRBD or similar ). There is usually not much traffic in this
folder.


=== wkhtmltopdf
wkhtmltopdf is no longer required and has been replaced by phantomjs.


=== phantomjs
phantomjs is required to create PDF reports with the reports2 plugin. You can get
phantomjs from http://phantomjs.org/ if it's not available for your system.


=== How can I enable the business process addon.
It works out of the box with OMD. If not using OMD, some manual steps
are required which are described in the
link:business-process.html[official documenation].


== Hacking Thruk
=== Within OMD
If you are using OMD, then you just might want to follow this guide:
https://github.com/sni/omd_utils/tree/master/thruk_developer
Which connects a test OMD site to the git version of Thruk. This works quite
well as long as there are only small changes in the perl module dependencies.

The installer adds a new OMD daemon which restarts Thruk whenever you change
a perl file or template.

=== Install Test Environment from Source
 1. First get a fresh copy of the sources:

  /tmp %> git clone git://github.com/sni/Thruk.git

 2. Create a .author file which prevents some caching mechanisms.

  /tmp %> cd Thruk && touch .author

3. use perl dependencies from existing installation.

  /tmp/Thruk %> export PERL5LIB=/usr/lib/thruk/perl5
+
Refer to the official documentation on how to install Thruk: link:install.html

4. start development server

  /tmp/Thruk %> ./script/thruk_server.pl -r
  HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:3000/

5. hack Thruk...

6. create a git patch
+
review and commit your changes, then create a patch file which can be sent upstream to the author.

  /tmp/Thruk %> git commit -av
  /tmp/Thruk %> git format-patch -o /tmp/ --signoff -1



== Errors
=== Backend not available

The socat solution for using livestatus with SSL does not longer work
due to problems with socat and json data. If you see errors like:

------------------
[ERROR][Thruk.Controller.Root] Caught exception in Thruk::Controller::status->index "socket error at thruk/script/../lib/Monitoring/Livestatus/Class/Base/Table.pm line 186"
[ERROR][Thruk.Controller.error] internal server error
------------------

and you use socat for livestatus over ssl, please change to stunnel or
ssh with the normal xinetd solution.

=== undefined symbol: Perl_Istack_sp_ptr

You will get perl errors about undefined symbols when you try to
install a debian package on ubuntu or a ubuntu 11 deb file on ubuntu
12 or any package on a different platform than the package was build
for.

------------------
/usr/bin/perl: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/thruk/perl5/x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi/auto/List/Util/Util.so: undefined symbol: Perl_Istack_sp_ptr
------------------

The solution is simple: use the right package for your distribution.
If there is no package is available for your platform, use the source
installation.



=== Premature end of script headers: fcgid_env.sh

A few things to check:

- check the apache error log for more details.
- check the thruk logfile, usually located in /var/log/thruk/error.log
- if you are using Redhat/Centos, check if you have SELinux enabled:
+
  #>getenforce
  Disabled
+
'Enforcing' means SELinux is enable. Details can be found in the audit
log: /var/log/audit/audit.log.  SELinux can be disabled in
'/etc/selinux/config' (you will have to reboot once to make the
changes active).
+
  SELINUX=disabled
+
Read more about SELinux on http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SELinux


If there is no error in either apache or thruk logs, try to manually run the
fcgi script with your webserver user (usually something like `www-data` or
`apache`)

+
  su - www-data -c "/usr/share/thruk/fcgid_env.sh"
  STDIN is not a socket: specify a listen location at /usr/lib/thruk/perl5/Plack/Handler/FCGI.pm line 57.
+

If you see the error above, eveything is ok. Otherwise you should see the real
error now.


=== possible csrf, no or invalid token

This happens if you directly send commands to Thruk without a valid
csrf protection token. This will happen in combination with nagstamon.
You have to put those clients in the exception list:
link:configuration.html#csrf_allowed_hosts[csrf_allowed_hosts].

More information about link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[csrf].


=== Error: TypeError: $.browser is undefined

Assuming you are using the ssi file to display PNP4Nagios popups, you have to update
the ssi files to the latest from link:https://github.com/sni/Thruk/tree/master/ssi[Thruks examples].

The cluetip jquery plugin used in this popups does not work with the latest jQuery release
from Thruk, so Thruk now ships a own updated copy for this javascript library.

== Installation

There are several ways of installing Thruk.

=== Labs Consol Repository
The https://labs.consol.de/repo/[Labs Repository] provides packages of
latest Thruk releases (including daily development builds) and other
Tools like Mod-Gearman. Just follow the guide on the labs page for
your distribution.


=== OMD
An easy way of installing Thruk is using OMD from
http://omdistro.org[omdistro.org]. There are Debian, Ubuntu, Centos
and Suse Packages containing preconfigured latest versions of Nagios
and Thruk. The package also includes Icinga, Shinken, pnp4nagios,
check_mk and Nagvis. OMD is the recommended way of installing new
Nagios / Thruk setups when you want to install several addons at once.


=== Use Packages
Standalone installation from a binary package is another easy way
to get Thruk running.

Download packages from the link:../download.html[download page].

All packages have the following filesystem structure:

-------
  /etc/thruk                       Thruks config
  /etc/httpd/conf.d/thruk.conf     Apache config
  /usr/share/thruk                 shared files
  /usr/lib/thruk/perl5             Perl libraries
  /var/cache/thruk                 temporary files
  /var/lib/thruk                   stored user settings
-------

After installation, Thruk is available at http://your-host/thruk/ and
has a default user 'thrukadmin' with password 'thrukadmin' configured.
You may need to change backend configuration. This should be done in
the thruk_local.conf where all settings can be overridden.



==== Debian / Ubuntu

-------
  #> dpkg -i thruk_1.84_debian6_amd64.deb
-------

In case of dependency errors, run 'apt-get -f install' and try the
'dpkg -i...' again.


==== Centos / Redhat

-------
  #> yum install --nogpgcheck thruk-1.84-1.rhel6.x86_64.rpm
-------

You may need to include an external repository for mod_fastcgi module.
Epel or Rpmforge should do it.


==== SLES

-------
  #> zypper install thruk-1.84-1.sles11.x86_64.rpm
-------

You may need the SLES sdk dvd for additional dependencies.


=== Source Installation

A link:install_from_source.html[Source Installation] can sometimes be usefull if you
have special requirements to paths and users. This is only for experienced users
and should be considered as last resort.

There is a separate page with link:install_from_source.html[detailed  Instructions].


== Configuration

The `thruk.conf` will be overwritten with new defaults on updates. The
thruk_local.conf contains the local overrides and will never be
overwritten.

-------
    /etc/thruk/thruk_local.conf
    /etc/thruk/cgi.cfg
-------

See the link:configuration.html[Thruk Configuration] section for detailed explaination of options from the `thruk_local.conf`.

See the link:cgi-cfg.html[CGI Configuration] section for options from the `cgi.cfg` file.




== Apache Configuration

[TIP]
.apache is preconfigured when using packages
=======
Apache configuration is not needed if you use OMD or packages. Apache
is already preconfigured in that case.
=======

Apache configuration is covered in the link:install-webserver.html[Webserver Integration] section.




== Backend Configuration

You may connect multiple backends into one Thruk interface. Just specify
multiple 'peer' items.

=== Livestatus

Livestatus is a addon for Naemon, Nagios or Icinga which provides real time
status data. Contrary to database addons it adds very little overhead to the
Naemon core which makes livestatus based gui fast and real time.

[TIP]
.Shinken
=======
Shinken has livestatus support built-in and does not require additional
modules.
=======

Refer to http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html#H1:%20Setting%20up%20and%20using%20Livestatus
on how to install livestatus onto your monitoring box. The
<<labs-consol-repository,Lab Consol Repository>> has livestatus rpm
packages. For debian based Linux systems just use the provided
packages of your distribution.

Basically you have to build the NEB module and add it to your naemon.cfg,
nagios.cfg or icinga.cfg.

-------
 broker_module=/opt/local/livestatus/livestatus.o /tmp/live.sock
-------

Then use the socket as 'peer' parameter in your backend configuration.

=== HTTP

A HTTP connection is possible between multiple Thruk installations. A
HTTP connection not only makes live data available, it also offers a
secure way to manage object configuration from remote. To authenticate
the central Thruk installation, you need to provide the secret key from the
slave instance. This setup is perfect for managing several independent
installations from a central point of view.

[TIP]
.use SSL
=======
It's strongly recommended to use HTTPS for remote connections.
=======

-------
    # package installation
    %> cat /var/lib/thruk/secret.key

    # omd site
    OMD[site]:~$ cat var/thruk/secret.key
-------

=== MongoDB
The MongoDB is not a real backend for status data, but it can be used as a
logfile cache. If unsure whether to use MongoDB or MySQL, use MySQL which is
newer and faster. The MongoDB logfile cache may be deprecated in the future.

ex.:

  logcache = mongodb://localhost:27017/thruk_logs

Details are explained in the link:logfile-cache.html[Logfile Cache] section.


=== MySQL
The MySQL Database is not a real backend for status data, but it can be used as a
logfile cache. If unsure whether to use MongoDB or MySQL, use MySQL which is
newer and faster. The MongoDB logfile cache may be deprecated in the future.

ex.:

  logcache = mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/thruk_logs

Details are explained in the link:logfile-cache.html[Logfile Cache] section.

== How it works

Thruk is written in Perl using the
http://www.catalystframework.org[Catalyst Framework]. Backend
monitoring systems will be connected with the
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Livestatus[Monitoring::Livestatus]
Perl Module. Thruk itself is running as a fastcgi process.
Availability will be calculated with
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Availability[Monitoring::Availability].
Authentication is provided by the Apache webserver (For example with
mod_auth_basic, mod_auth_ldap, mod_auth_mysql, ...).

== Reasons to choose Thruk

There are a couple of cool things in Thruk. A few of them are listed
here.


== Multi Site Support

Thruk connects to as many cores as you want. You could even combine
Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken instances into one big combined view. That
way you get the advantage of several independent locations and still
have an overview about all your installations. Sites can be put into
groups for better arrangement.

== Flexible Dashboard

Thruk panorama plugin provides a super flexible dashboard solution. Every user
can build its own dashboards with a few clicks and share them to colleagues. Various
elements and backgrounds and images can be positioned free without any constrains.
Multiple Dashboards can be linked together and connected to actions. This allows
you to create your own control center.

== SLA Reports
The 'reporting' plugin creates comprehensive SLA reports in HTML and PDF format
which may be send by mail at regular intervals. Besides that you may turn any
page in Thruk into a regular E-Mail report.

== Business Process Integration
Using the Business Process addon allows modeling your important applications and
business processes. Online editor and notifications included.

== Excel Export and Bookmarks

The Bookmarks feature allows you to save your searches and add them as
your personal menu item. Besides the bookmarks, you can adjust the
menu easily with the menu_local.conf for all users.

The Excel export creates real Excel files which can be send by mail or
used to extract hostnames and other information.

== Config Tool

The Config Tool makes is very easy to change object configuration of
your monitoring solution. It also allows you to make quick changes to your
Thruk configuration, as well as managing user access via htpasswd
files or adjusting your cgi.cfg.

== Sending Multiple Commands

The new status pages makes it very convenient to send multiple commands
at once. It is even possible to send host and service commands at the
same time. When rescheduling hosts and services, Thruk will wait until
your check is finished and display the result as soon as the check has
come back.

== Easy Filtering

Remember the days when you had to guess numbers in the url to filter
hosts or services. With Thruk it's possible to quickly change your
display filter. You can combine multiple filter to create whatever
views you like. An Ajax search supports you, so you don't have to
guess host or service names, plus you get the power of regular expressions.

== PNP4Nagios Graphs

When your action_url contains /pnp4nagios/, there will be automatically
a graph displayed for your host and service. This gives you a quick
view about the performance history. The image is then linked to
PNP4Nagios to get detailed information.

== Multiple Lines of Plugin Output

When your check returns multiple lines of plugin output. Thruk marks
the output in blue and a click on it displays the complete output.
This is especially useful for check_multi checks. In addition to
that, the comments and downtimes also have a small popup with their
data. So you don't have to open the host/service page just to see who
set a comment and when there is a downtime.

== Mine Map

The Mine Map is the perfect tool to get a quick overview. It is
especially useful if you have a lot of common services across your
hosts. Otherwise use hostgroups or servicegroups for nice results.
Normal filtering is possible too.

== Mobile Interface

The Mobile interface gives you access to the most important things
and allows you to quickly view and acknowledge problems.

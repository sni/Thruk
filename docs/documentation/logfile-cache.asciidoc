== Logfile Cache
Accessing logfiles can be time and memory consuming, especially when having
remote sites connected to Thruk. Livestatus caches logfile data used for
queries. This increases the size of the naemon process, slows down the
monitoring and increases the overall load on your monitoring host. Therefor
Thruk may use a logfile cache to increase performance of logfile access and
reports.

[WARNING]
The MongoDB logcache is deprecated and got removed from Thruk in 2016. Use the MySQL logcache instead.

For maximum performance, the Logfile Cache Database should be installed on the
same server as Thruk itself (or at least in the same network).

=== Configuration

[TIP]
Starting with OMD-Labs 2.40 you can simply run `omd config set THRUK_LOGCACHE on` to enable the logcache.

You will need to specify your mysql connection configuration in your
thruk_local.conf. Make sure the user and database exists. The tables will then
be created automatically.

thruk_local.conf:
-------
  logcache = mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/thruk_logs
-------

[TIP]
.create mysql user and tables
=======
 #> mysql -u root -p
 mysql> CREATE USER 'thruk'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '****';
 mysql> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `thruk_logs`;
 mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `thruk_logs`.* TO 'thruk'@'localhost';
=======


=== Actions

==== Import
It's a good idea to import the logfiles after enabling the
logfilecache:

Initial import:
-------
    %> thruk -a logcacheimport --local
    ...
    OK - imported 20374 log items from 1 site successfully in 4.94s (4122/s)
-------

Be careful, the 'logcacheimport' deletes all current cached data, so only
do that once.

Depending on the size, this may take a while.

==== Update

Logfile Cache Update
-------
    %> thruk -a logcacheupdate
    OK - imported 3 log items from 3 sites successfully in 0.13s (23/s)
-------

The logcacheupdate imports the delta since the last update. That's pretty
fast and done automatically whenever you access logfiles via Thruk. However,
if you access the eventlog page only once in a while, it would be a good idea
to update the logcache periodically by a cronjob.


==== Import from Logfile Archive Files
The MySQL logcache supports import from files too. Duplicates are not imported
twice, so you can do that safely as often as you like.

-------
    %> thruk -a logcacheupdate --local /var/log/naemon/archive/naemon-09-07-2012-00.log
    OK - imported 2 log items from 1 site successfully in 0.01s (247/s)
-------


==== Authentication Update

The cache needs authentication information which has to be updated whenever
contacts have changed.

Update logfile caches authentication information:
-------
    %> thruk -a logcacheauthupdate
    OK - updated 71 log items from 3 sites successfully in 0.25s (286/s)
-------


==== Cleanup
You may want to remove old logfile entries from time to time. This is possible
with the logcacheclean command. Optionally you can define the number of days
which should be kept in the cache.

-------
    %> thruk -a logcacheclean=730
    OK - removed 18046 log items from 1 site successfully in 0.08s (218816/s)
-------



==== Statistics

There is also a command to check the current usage statistics of your
logfile cache:

-------
    %> thruk -a logcachestats
    Backend              Index Size      Data Size       Items
    Devel                 14.4 MB        136.4 MB       238104
-------


=== Example Cronjobs
Using the logfile cache needs some extra maintainance to work smoothly, the
following cronjobs should cover that. When not using OMD, you will have to
adjust the paths.

-------
  # update logcache data
  */5 * * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheupdate     >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1

  # update authentication data in our logcache
  0   2 * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheauthupdate >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1

  # optimize and repair tables
  0  20 * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheoptimize   >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1

  # clean logfiles from cache after two years
  0   1 * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheclean=730  >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1
-------


=== Icinga 2
When using Icinga 2 it is highly recommended to use the logcache with a file
import because the Livestatus API returns wrong results for the logs table in
Icinga 2.

Therefor we recommend the following settings (OMD-Labs):

etc/thruk/thruk_local.d/logcache.conf:
-------
  logcache = mysql://root@tmp/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock/thruk_logs
  logcache_delta_updates = 0
  report_update_logcache = 0
-------

This disables on-demand updates which won't work.


Then use a slightly changed crontab which imports the logfiles directly from the
compat logfiles.

etc/cron.d/thruk_logcache
-------
  # update logcache data
  * * * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheupdate var/icinga2/log/icinga2/compat/icinga.log >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1
  5 0 * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheupdate $(ls -1tr var/icinga2/log/icinga2/compat/archives/*.log) >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1

  # update authentication data in our logcache
  0   2 * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheauthupdate >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1

  # optimize and repair tables
  0  20 * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheoptimize   >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1

  # clean logfiles from cache after two years
  0   1 * * * $OMD_ROOT/bin/thruk -a logcacheclean=730  >>$OMD_ROOT/var/log/thruk.log 2>&1

== SLA Reporting

=== Installation

This plugin is marked as optional/recommends due to depedencies to xlibs, xvfb and fonts.

To install use the package 'thruk-plugin-reporting' from Consol Labs Repository.

=== How it works

SLA Reporting consists of several steps.

 - report configuration
 - report template
 - converting html report into pdf
 - optionally send report by mail

==== Report Configuration

You can create and adjust report settings on the 'Reporting' page.
Make sure the plugin is enabled. After selecting a template for your
report you have to set specific types of input fields on the second
page. If you make you report public, everyone can view and refresh the
report.

==== Report Templates

All templates used for reports can be found in
'plugins/plugins-enabled/reports2/templates/reports'.
You may adjust or override all templates to your needs and put them
into a 'reports' subfolder of the 'user_template_path'.

------
  | reports     contains the selectable reports
  |- comp       contains components used in reports
  |- locale     contains localization settings
  |- style      contains css used to make reports pretty
------

See link:../api/Thruk/Utils/Reports/Render.html for details on
available functions and examples.

The Templates itself are written in Template::Toolkit which is
perfectly documented at http://template-toolkit.org/docs/manual/index.html

==== Converting

The generated HTML report will be converted into a pdf file using wkhtml2pdf
together with xvfb. Both tools must be installed on Thruks host. There is
a binary download for wkhtml2pdf on http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/.
Use at least the 0.11 version or later.



==== Sending Reports By Mail

It's quite easy to setup sla reports by mail. All you need is to
create send option in the report configuration. It is even possible to
send one report at multiple times.


=== Customized Reports
Reports can be customized with some HTML and CSS knowledge. Reports in general
have several blocks which specify the steps done to produce the report.

  * styles
  * edit
  * prepare
  * render
  * mail

==== Styles
Customizing css styles of your reports is easy. You need to create a
new file 'reports/style/custom.tt' below your 'user_template_path'.

For example:

------
<style type="text/css">
/* override css styles */
BODY {
    font-family: arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 11px;
    line-height: 18px;
    font-size: 16px;
}
</style>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
/* add complete new elements by javascript */
  jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('<img src="' + url_prefix + 'themes/Thruk/images/logo_thruk.png">').insertBefore('DIV.page.cover DIV.titletext');
  });
</script>
------

If thats not enough, you still can change each and every template used to create the reports.



==== Edit Block
The edit block contains configuration items used for this report. They create
the edit page when someone chooses to create or edit a report of this type.
Basically this block contains all required and optional fields used for this
report.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'edit' %]
  [%
    required_fields = [
        { 'host'       => [ 'Host',        'hosts',         ''              , '', 1 ] },
        { 'timeperiod' => [ 'Timeperiod',  'rptimeperiod',  'last12months'          ] },
    ];
  %]
[% END %]
------

The key in that hash defines the parameter by which that value can be accessed
later. Each field has to point to an array with at least 3 values. The required
flag is optional.

  * Name
  * Type
  * Default value
  * Required Flag



==== Prepare Block
The prepare block is used to gather data used in the report. Usually it's been
used to get availability data via livestatus or fetch events from logfiles.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'prepare' %]
  [%
    set_unavailable_states(param.unavailable);
    calculate_availability();
  %]
[% END %]
------

You may use all functions available from the link:../api/Thruk/Utils/Reports/Render.html[Render Helper]


==== Render Block
The render block defines the layout of the report.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'render' %]
  [% PROCESS 'reports/locale/en.tt' %]
  [%
    title        = 'Hello World Report'
    subtitle     = r.name
    coverdetails = [ 'Report Timeperiod:', get_report_timeperiod(start, end, reportDateFormat),
                     'Host:', param.host,
                   ]
  %]

  [% WRAPPER 'reports/comp/report.tt' %]
    [% WRAPPER 'reports/comp/page_cover.tt' %][% END %]
    [% WRAPPER 'reports/comp/page_standard.tt' %]
      <b>hello world</b>
    [% END %]
  [% END %]
[% END %]
------

This report would contain 2 pages. First you wrap everything into the report.tt
which defines the basic report layout and contains the stylesheets.
Then you have to define some settings used by the cover page. 'r' is a reference
to the report object, in this example we just use that as subtitle. 'coverdetails'
is a list of name / value pairs used in the details list on the cover page.
Finally we wrap a 'hello world' in a standard page. The content could contain
standard HTML tags like tables and images as well.


==== Mail Block
Finally we define a mail block which is used for the mail layout if a report
is sent by e-mail.

For example:

------
[% IF block == 'mail' +%]
SUBJECT: Report: [% r.name %]

Your report is attached.

[% IF r.desc %]Description: [%+ r.desc %][% END %]
[%+ END %]
------

We use the report name 'r.name' as subject and put the report description 'r.desc'
in the body.


==== Custom Perl Render Helper
You may create a Perl Module named
'Thruk::Utils::Reports::CustomRender' which will be automatically made
available to the stash, so functions from this module can be used in
the reporting templates.

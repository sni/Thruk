== REST API
{% include new_since.ad version="2.24" %}
Thruk offers a rest api to expose various aspects of Thruk itself and
livestatus information.

 * You can find lots of examples on the link:rest_examples.html[REST API examples page].
 * A list of external commands is here: link:rest_commands.html[REST API commands].

The api can be either accessed by http(s) at http://your_webserver/thruk/r/ or
by cli client:

------
  %> thruk r /hostgroups
------

== Versions

Right now, there is only version 1 of the rest api, so you can either use the
generic url http://your_webserver/thruk/r/ or the version specific
http://your_webserver/thruk/r/v1/.


== Authentication

=== Basic Auth

Using the web api, you can simply pass username and password as http basic
authentication like:

------
  %> curl -k https://user:password@your_webserver/thruk/r/
------

Data is collected with the permissions of the given user.

=== Cookie Auth

Cookies from the cookie authentication are valid as well if you are logged in
already and will return the results with permissions of the current user.

=== Secret Key

The web rest api accepts the secret key as http header. The secret key
is usually found in `/var/lib/thruk/secret.key` or `var/thruk/secret.key`
when using OMD.

------
  %> curl -H 'X-Thruk-Auth-Key: secretkey' \
          -H 'X-Thruk-Auth-User: thrukadmin' \
          -gk 'https://localhost/thruk/r/hosts
------

Since the secretkey gives you superadminpower. You can set the context of the
result to any user you like with the `X-Thruk-Auth-User` HTTP header.

=== Command Line

When using the cli clients, use the `-A` option like:

------
  %> thruk -A user r /
------

Having command line access gives you superadminpower as well, so you can set
the user context to any user you need with the `-A` switch.


== Parameters
You can pass parameters mostly along with `POST` and `PATCH` requests. When
using the cli tool, you can utilize the `-d` parameter with key/value pairs or
with json data. Or you can mix those options.

use key/value pairs:

------
  %> thruk r -m PATCH -d max_check_attempts=3 -d first_notification_delay=10 /hosts/localhost/config
------

use json structure:

------
  %> thruk r -m PATCH -d "{'max_check_attempts':3, 'first_notification_delay':10}" /hosts/localhost/config
------

Using curl, you can set parameters like this:

------
  %> curl -d "alias=test" -d "max_check_attempts=3" http://your_webserver/thruk/r/hosts/localhost/config
------

or you can use json data as well:

------
  %> curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --X PATCH \
          --data '{"max_check_attempts":3, "first_notification=delay":10}' \
          http://your_webserver/thruk/r/hosts/localhost/config
------

== Filtering

All pages offer filtering using query parameters:

------
  %> thruk r '/hosts?name=localhost'
------

Other operators besides equals like regular expressions are possible with the
bracket syntax:

ex.: return all hosts starting with literal `m`:

------
  %> thruk r '/hosts?name[regex]=^m'
------


ex.: list all services which are currently in a downtime:

------
  %> thruk r '/services?scheduled_downtime_depth[gte]=1'
------

Curl requires you to set the `globoff` option:

------
  %> curl -gk 'https://user:pass@localhost/thruk/r/hosts?name[regex]=^t'
------


Possible operators with their alias:

[options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================
|Operator  |Alias    |Description
| =        | eq      |Equal match
| !=       | ne      |Not equal match
| ~        | regex   |Regular expression match
| !~       | nregex  |Not regular expression match
| >        | gt      |Greater than numeric comparisson
| <        | lt      |Lower than numeric comparisson
| >=       | gte     |Greater or equal numeric comparisson. `contains` in list context
| <=       | lte     |Lower or equal numeric comparisson. `contains not` in list context
|==========================

You can use the alias name to workaround urlencoding issues.

== Sorting

All pages can sort list results by using the `sort` parameter. The sort
parameter can be used multiple times or use comma-separated lists. The order is
ascending unless prefixed with an minus.

ex.: sort by name ascending and status descending:

------
  %> thruk r /hosts?sort=name,-state
------

== Limits

All pages offer limits and offset through the `limit` and `offset` parameter.

For example show 10 hosts starting at offset 100:

------
  %> thruk r /hosts?limit=10&offset=100
------

== Columns

All pages offer setting columns with the `columns` parameter.

ex.: return name and state for all hosts:

------
  %> thruk r /hosts?columns=name,state
------


== Backends / Sites

If you have multiple sites connected to Thruk, you may want to talk only to
specific sites. There are multiple methods to set the backends for your
request. You can combine multiple sites with commas.

Use a path prefix `/sites/<sitename,...>`:

------
  %> thruk r /sites/test,prod/hosts
------

Use the `backends` option with the cli client:

------
  %> thruk r -b test,prod /hosts
------

Set the `backends` url parameter:

------
  %> thruk r /hosts?backends=test,prod
------


== Error Handling

Failed rest requests return a hash result along with a HTTP error code:

------
  %> thruk r /none
  {
    "code" : 404,
    "message" : "unknown rest path"
    "description" : "optional additional error messages"
  }
------

== Output Formats

=== JSON

JSON is the default output format.

=== CSV

CSV output is available via `/csv/` path prefix.

------
  %> thruk r /csv/hosts?columns=name,state
------

------
  %> curl -g http://localhost/thruk/r/csv/hosts/stats
------

=== XLS

Excel output is available via `/xls/` path prefix.

------
  %> thruk r /xls/hosts?columns=name,state
------

== HTTP Methods

HTTP Methods are implemented according to link:https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9[RFC2616] which
is in short:

[options="header"]
|===========================================
| GET     | retrieve ressources, ex.: `GET /thruk/reports` to list all reports.
| POST    | update/create ressources or trigger actions, ex.: `POST /thruk/reports` to create a new report.
| PUT     | overwrite existing ressource, ex.: `PUT /thruk/reports/1` to update an entire existing report. Thruk makes no difference between POST and PUT. You can use PUT for all POST urls and vice versa.
| PATCH   | replace parts of existing ressource, ex.: `PATCH /thruk/reports/1` to set specific attributes of an existing report.
| DELETE  | remove existing ressource, ex.: `DELETE /thruk/reports/1` to remove the report entirely.
|===========================================

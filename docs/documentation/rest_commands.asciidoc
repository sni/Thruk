== REST API Commands
{% include new_since.ad version="2.24" %}
Thruk offers a rest api to expose various aspects of Thruk itself and
livestatus information.

Read more about the link:rest.html[REST API] itself. This page contains
the comprehensive list of all available external commands.

== Response

In case the command was successful, a simple json message is returned:

------
    %> thruk r -d "comment_data=test" /hosts/localhost/cmd/schedule_host_downtime
    {
      "message" : "Command successfully submitted"
    }
------

However, due to the way external commands are implemented throughout the various
cores, this message does not neccessarily mean the command was successful. Only
the submission was successful.

If the core supports it (which is currently only Naemon >= 1.0.9) you will get
a error response if something did not work like this:

------
    %> thruk r -d "comment_data=test" -d "triggered_by=xxx" /hosts/localhost/cmd/schedule_host_downtime
    {
      "code" : 400,
      "error" : "400: Couldn't parse ulong argument trigger_id (argument 4): No digits found in ulong 'xxx'\n",
      "message" : "sending command failed"
    }
------


== Arguments and default values

Each command can have required and optional arguments which are listed along with
the command itself.

Some of the arguments have default values:

  - `comment_author`: defaults to the current user and cannot be changed usually
  - `fixed`:          defaults to 1
  - `duration`:       defaults to 0
  - `triggered_by`:   defaults to 0
  - `start_time`:     defaults to now
  - `end_time`:       defaults to now + downtime_duration from the thruk.conf


=== Relative timestamps

Timestamps, like start_date and end_date can be relative to get more reusable commands.

------
    %> thruk r -d "end_time=+60m" -d "comment_data='downtime comment'" '/services/<host>/<svc>/cmd/schedule_svc_downtime'
------

This will create a 1hour downtime. Other suffixes are:

  - `y`: years
  - `w`: weeks
  - `d`: days
  - `h`: hours
  - `m`: minutes


== Example Usage

All examples can be found on the link:rest_examples.html#sending_commands[REST API Examples page].

== Endpoints

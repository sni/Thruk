Themes
======

Thruks look & feel can be easily changed with themes. There are a few
themes already included. Themes normally reside in the
'themes/themes-available' directory. Activate a theme by creating a symlink
in the 'themes/themes-enabled' directory. If you use the packaged Thruk
version, the themes folder is directly in your Thruk folder. If you are using
OMD, the themes folder is in $OMD_ROOT/etc/thruk/themes.

Example of a themes:
----
  theme/
  ├── images
  └── stylesheets
----


Installation
------------
Installation of a theme is easy:

.Installation
. Unpack the theme in 'themes-available' directory.
. Create a symlink in 'themes-enabled' which points to the theme.
. Restart Thruk (if you use mod_fastcgi) or your webserver (if you use mod_fcgid)

.Deactivate
. Remove the symlink from 'themes-enabled'
. Restart Thruk (if you use mod_fastcgi) or your webserver (if you use mod_fcgid)

.Uninstall
. Remove themes from 'themes-available'

Write your own themes
----------------------

The directory structure of a theme contains just a few folders and you
don't need all of them for every theme.

----
  MyTheme/
  ├── images
  └── stylesheets
----

.Structure
* 'images' containts all images needed by this theme. Make sure you
  have at least the basic images.
* 'stylesheets' contain your css files.


TIP: There is a repository for a custom theme template and example here: https://github.com/sni/thruk-custom-themes-example

Let me know if you want to get your theme listed here.

Nagios Neat: A pure CSS solution for a drab Nagios
Release 001 - jacob.laack@alegent.org

Description:
Nagios Neat is a "skin" for Nagios.  The original stylesheets for Nagios 3.0
have been modified to provide a different presentation of the HTML created by
the Nagios CGIs.  Combined with new background images, these new stylesheets
should provide an easy way to spruce up Nagios without requiring heavy
modification of an original Nagios installation.

Installation:
Replace the "stylesheets" directory in the Nagios web content folder (usually
/usr/local/nagios/share/stylesheets) with the contents of this folder.
Easy, huh?

Notes:
* The stylesheets also contain styles to hide unnecessary "stuff" when
printing.
* When upgrading Nagios, the contents of Nagios' stylesheets directory may be
wiped out during the final "make install".
* This skin may work for Nagios 2.0 or earlier but this hasn't been tested.
If it works for your older Nagios system, please let me know.

Thanks:
...to Nagios for being awesome.
...to the Nagios Community for providing plugins and add ons which, when added
to Nagios, end up making me look good.

If this "skin" is found to be useful, please review it on http://www.nagiosexchange.org.  If something doesn't work correctly, feel free to e-mail me, however, I can't guarantee a speedy fix.  Thanks.

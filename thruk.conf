# This might be useful if you pull the logfiles from a ndo/ido database.
# There are some useful enviromenet variables set before the script is started:
# REMOTE_USER contains the current user.
# THRUK_BACKEND  is a the id of the backends to import.
# THRUK_LOGCACHE_START is start date to fetch
# THRUK_LOGCACHE_END   is the end date to fetch
# THRUK_LOGCACHE_LIMIT is the optional limit of logfiles to fetch

# The sitepanel is used to display multiple backends/sites at a glance.
# With than 10 or more sites, the list of backends will be combined
# into the 'compact' site panel which just displays the totals of
# available / down / disabled sites. The 'compact' panel will also
# automatically be used if you use sections.
# With more than 50 backends, the 'collapsed' will be selected in 'auto' mode.
# Set sitepanel to list/compact/collapsed/auto/off to change the default behaviour.
